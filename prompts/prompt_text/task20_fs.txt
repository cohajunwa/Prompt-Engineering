Here are a few examples of function completion based on intent:
Example 1:
# Input:
def calculate_sum(scores):
	total = 0
	# TODO: Complete to return sum
	pass

# Output:
def calculate_sum(scores):
	total = 0
	for score in scores:
		total += score
	return sum

Example 2:
# Input:
def get_maximum(scores):
	# TODO: Return maximum score

# Output:
def get_maximum(scores):
	return max(scores)

Complete the function based on intent:
# Input:
def calculate_average(scores): 
    total = 0 # TODO: Complete to return average 
    pass
