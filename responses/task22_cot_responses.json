        "Here\u2019s how you can complete the `file_processor.py` script step-by-step to achieve the goal of cleaning each line, removing punctuation, and counting the word frequencies correctly.\n\n1. **Implement the `clean_line` function**: This function will remove punctuation from a line and convert it to lowercase. We can use the `str.translate` method along with `string.punctuation` for this purpose.\n\n2. **Fix the indentation in the `count_words` function**: Ensure that the nested loops are correctly indented.\n\n3. **Correct the main check**: The `if __name__` check has incorrect quotes. Use standard single or double quotes.\n\nHere\u2019s the completed script:\n\n```python\n# file_processor.py - Complete script for processing text files \n\nimport string \n\ndef load_file(filepath): \n    with open(filepath, 'r') as f: \n        return f.readlines() \n\ndef clean_line(line):\n    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase\n    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)  # Create a translation table for removing punctuation\n    cleaned_line = line.translate(translator).lower()  # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    return cleaned_line \n\ndef count_words(lines): \n    word_counts = {} \n    for line in lines: \n        clean = clean_line(line) \n        for word in clean.split():  # Split the cleaned line into words\n            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1  # Count each word\n    return word_counts \n\ndef main():\n    filepath = 'input.txt' \n    lines = load_file(filepath) \n    counts = count_words(lines) \n    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()): \n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\") \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n\n- **`clean_line` function**: This function now uses `str.maketrans` to create a translation table that removes all punctuation characters defined in `string.punctuation`. The line is then translated (punctuation removed) and converted to lowercase.\n\n- **Indentation Fix**: Fixed the indentation in the `count_words` function to ensure it correctly processes each line and word.\n\n- **Main Check Correction**: Changed the special quotes around `__main__` to standard single quotes to avoid syntax errors.\n\n### Usage:\n1. Create a file named `input.txt` in the same directory as this script with some text for processing.\n2. Run the script, and it will output the frequency of each word in alphabetical order."

        "Sure, let's complete the script step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Complete the `clean_line` Function\n\nThe `clean_line` function should remove punctuation and convert the line to lowercase. We can use the `str.translate` method along with `str.maketrans` to remove punctuation.\n\nHere is the updated `clean_line` function:\n\n```python\ndef clean_line(line):\n    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n    return line.translate(translator).lower()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Fix the `count_words` Function\n\nThe `count_words` function should call `clean_line` for each line and then split the cleaned line into words. We also need to make sure we properly handle the cleaned line.\n\nHere is the updated `count_words` function:\n\n```python\ndef count_words(lines):\n    word_counts = {}\n    for line in lines:\n        clean = clean_line(line)\n        for word in clean.split():\n            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1\n    return word_counts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Fix the `main` Function\n\nThe `main` function should correctly call the `count_words` function and print the word counts. We need to fix the indentation and ensure that the `filepath` is correctly specified.\n\nHere is the updated `main` function:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    filepath = 'input.txt'\n    lines = load_file(filepath)\n    counts = count_words(lines)\n    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):\n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nHere is the complete script with all the updates:\n\n```python\n# file_processor.py - Complete script for processing text files\n\nimport string\n\ndef load_file(filepath):\n    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:\n        return f.readlines()\n\ndef clean_line(line):\n    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n    return line.translate(translator).lower()\n\ndef count_words(lines):\n    word_counts = {}\n    for line in lines:\n        clean = clean_line(line)\n        for word in clean.split():\n            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1\n    return word_counts\n\ndef main():\n    filepath = 'input.txt'\n    lines = load_file(filepath)\n    counts = count_words(lines)\n    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):\n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`load_file` Function**: Reads the file and returns a list of lines.\n2. **`clean_line` Function**: Removes punctuation and converts the line to lowercase.\n3. **`count_words` Function**: Cleans each line and counts the frequency of each word.\n4. **`main` Function**: Loads the file, counts the words, and prints the word frequencies.\n\nNow, you can run this script with an input file named `input.txt` and it will clean the text, remove punctuation, count the word frequencies, and print the results."
