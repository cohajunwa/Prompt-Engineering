        "The off-by-one error in the `sum_range` function occurs in the `for` loop where the `range(start, end)` is used. The `range` function generates numbers starting from `start` up to, but not including, `end`. Therefore, if the intention is to include the `end` value in the sum, the loop should iterate up to and including `end`. As it currently stands, the function will exclude `end` from the total sum.",
        "To fix the off-by-one error in the `sum_range` function, you need to modify the `range` function so that it includes the `end` value. You can do this by changing the range to `range(start, end + 1)`. Here is the corrected function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_range(start, end): \n    total = 0 \n    for i in range(start, end + 1): \n        total += i \n    return total\n```\n\nNow, this function will correctly calculate the sum of all integers from `start` to `end`, inclusive."
