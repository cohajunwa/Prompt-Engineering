        "To resolve the inconsistency between the function name and the logic in the provided function, we need to change either the function name or the logic so that they match. Since the function is supposed to determine if a number is odd, we can adjust the logic accordingly.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```cpp\n// Fix:\nbool isOdd(int x) { \n    return x % 2 != 0; // Correct logic to check if x is odd\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to keep the function name `isOdd`, the logic should be corrected to return `true` if `x` is odd, which is what the fixed code does.\n\nIf you wanted to change the function name to reflect what the logic is actually checking, you could rename it to `isEven`:\n\n```cpp\n// Fix:\nbool isEven(int x) { \n    return x % 2 == 0; // Logic now matches the function name\n}\n``` \n\nBoth options resolve the inconsistency."

        "To resolve the inconsistency between the function name and logic in the `isOdd` function, you need to ensure that the function returns `true` if `x` is odd, not even. Here is the corrected version of the function:\n\n```cpp\nbool isOdd(int x) {\n    return x % 2 != 0; // Correct logic to check if x is odd\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the function `isOdd` correctly returns `true` if `x` is odd by checking if `x % 2 != 0`. This ensures that the function name and its logic are consistent."
