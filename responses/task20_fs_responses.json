Here is the completed function:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(scores):\n    total = 0\n    for score in scores:\n        total += score\n    return total / len(scores)\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each score in the `scores` list, adds it to `total`, and then calculates the average by dividing `total` by the length of the `scores` list."
