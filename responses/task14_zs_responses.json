        "To complete the recursive function for calculating Fibonacci numbers, you'll need to define the base cases and the recursive call. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that:\n\n- `fibonacci(0) = 0`\n- `fibonacci(1) = 1`\n- For `n > 1`, `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)`\n\nHere's the completed function:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive call\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1, returning the corresponding Fibonacci values (0 and 1).\n- For any value of `n` greater than 1, it recursively calls itself to compute the Fibonacci numbers for `n-1` and `n-2`, and returns their sum. \n\nKeep in mind that this recursive approach has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations, so it's not efficient for large values of `n`. For larger Fibonacci numbers, consider using memoization or an iterative approach."

        "Certainly! The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here's how you can implement a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base cases\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive call\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Cases:**\n   - If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.\n   - If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.\n\n2. **Recursive Call:**\n   - For any other value of `n`, the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` and returns their sum.\n\n### Note:\nWhile this implementation is correct and simple, it has an exponential time complexity due to redundant calculations. For larger values of `n`, a more efficient approach like memoization or iterative calculation would be preferred.\n\nHere's an optimized version using memoization:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n, memo={}):\n    # Base cases\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Check if the value is already computed\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    # Compute the value and store it in the memo dictionary\n    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)\n    return memo[n]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n```\n\nThis version uses a dictionary `memo` to store already computed Fibonacci numbers, significantly improving performance for larger values of `n`."
