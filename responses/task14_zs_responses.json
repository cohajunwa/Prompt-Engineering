        "Certainly! The Fibonacci function can be defined recursively with two base cases: when `n` is 0 and when `n` is 1. The recursive call should compute the Fibonacci number by summing the two preceding numbers.\n\nHere's the completed function:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base case: if n is 0, return 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Base case: if n is 1, return 1\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: return the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.\n- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.\n- For any other value of `n`, the function calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2`, summing their results to compute `fibonacci(n)`."

        "Sure! Below is a complete implementation of the Fibonacci function using recursion in Python. The function includes the base cases and the recursive call.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base cases\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive call\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base cases**:\n   - If `n` is 0, return 0 (since `F(0) = 0`).\n   - If `n` is 1, return 1 (since `F(1) = 1`).\n\n2. **Recursive call**:\n   - For any other value of `n`, return the sum of `fibonacci(n - 1)` and `fibonacci(n - 2)`. This is because the Fibonacci sequence is defined as `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`.\n\nThis implementation is straightforward but has a significant drawback: it has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations. For larger values of `n`, this can be very inefficient. For better performance, consider using memoization or an iterative approach."
