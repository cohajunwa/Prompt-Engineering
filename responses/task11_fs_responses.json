        "To generate a function that checks if a number is prime, you can follow this approach:\n\n1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n2. To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, you need to ensure that it is not divisible by any number from 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\nHere is the function based on the given comment:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This function checks if a number is prime\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    max_divisor = math.isqrt(n)\n    for i in range(3, max_divisor + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Basic Checks**:\n   - If \\( n \\) is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is 2, it is prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is even and greater than 2, it is not prime.\n\n2. **Prime Checking Loop**:\n   - Calculate the integer square root of \\( n \\) using `math.isqrt(n)`.\n   - Loop through odd numbers from 3 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) (inclusive).\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - If none of the above conditions are met, \\( n \\) is prime.\n\nThis function efficiently checks for primality by reducing the number of iterations needed."
