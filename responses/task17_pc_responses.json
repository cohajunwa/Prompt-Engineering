        "The inconsistency in your function is between the function name and its logic. The function is named `isOdd`, which suggests that it should return `true` if the number `x` is odd. However, the logic implemented in the function actually checks if `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`) and returns `true` in that case.\n\nTo fix this inconsistency, you should either rename the function to reflect its actual logic or correct the logic to match the intended purpose of determining if a number is odd. Here are both options:\n\n### Option 1: Rename the Function\nIf you want to keep the logic as is (checking if a number is even), you can rename the function to `isEven`:\n\n```cpp\nbool isEven(int x) { \n    return x % 2 == 0; \n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Correct the Logic\nIf you want the function to return `true` when `x` is odd, you can keep the name `isOdd` and change the logic:\n\n```cpp\nbool isOdd(int x) { \n    return x % 2 != 0; \n}\n```\n\nChoose one of the options based on the intended functionality of the function.",
        "To resolve the inconsistency in the original function, we need to decide whether to change the function name or the logic. Since the name `isOdd` suggests that the function should check for odd numbers, let's go with the second option and correct the logic so that it accurately reflects the purpose of the name.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the function:\n\n```cpp\nbool isOdd(int x) { \n    return x % 2 != 0; \n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the function `isOdd` now returns `true` if `x` is odd (i.e., when `x % 2` is not equal to 0), which aligns with the function's name."

        "The inconsistency between the function name and the logic in the provided code lies in the function's name and its purpose. The function is named `isOdd`, which implies that it should return `true` if the input `x` is odd. However, the logic inside the function checks if `x` is even by using the expression `x % 2 == 0`.\n\nTo correct this inconsistency, you should update the function name to `isEven` or change the logic to check for oddness. Here are the two possible corrections:\n\n### Correction 1: Change the Function Name\nIf the function is supposed to check if `x` is even, then the name should reflect that:\n\n```cpp\nbool isEven(int x) {\n    return x % 2 == 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Correction 2: Change the Logic\nIf the function is supposed to check if `x` is odd, then the logic should be updated:\n\n```cpp\nbool isOdd(int x) {\n    return x % 2 != 0;\n}\n```\n\nChoose the correction that best fits the intended behavior of the function.",
        "Based on the original intention of the function (as stated in the comment), which is to return `true` if `x` is odd, we should correct the logic inside the function. Here is the corrected version of the function:\n\n```cpp\n// Returns true if x is odd\nbool isOdd(int x) {\n    return x % 2 != 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the function `isOdd` will return `true` if `x` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., if `x` is odd), and `false` otherwise. This aligns with the function name and the original comment."
