This field cannot be null.\n   - `book_id`: A foreign key that references the `id` of the `books` table. This field cannot be null.\n   - `rating`: An integer that stores the rating given by the user, constrained to be between 1 and 5.\n   - `created_at`: A timestamp that records when the review was created, with a default value of the current timestamp.\n   - `updated_at`: A timestamp that records when the review was last updated, with a default value of the current timestamp and an automatic update on row modification.\n   - Foreign key constraints ensure that if a user or book is deleted, any associated reviews will also be deleted (`ON DELETE CASCADE`).\n   - A unique constraint on the combination of `user_id` and `book_id` ensures that a user can only submit one review per book.\n\nThis schema is designed to maintain data integrity and facilitate the relationships between users, books, and their reviews effectively.",
        "Here's a schema design for a review app that includes tables for users, books, and reviews. The schema incorporates appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.\n\n### Schema Design\n\n```sql\n-- Users Table\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,        -- Unique identifier for each user\n    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL    -- Name of the user\n);\n\n-- Books Table\nCREATE TABLE books (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,        -- Unique identifier for each book\n    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL   -- Title of the book\n);\n\n-- Reviews Table\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,         -- Unique identifier for each review\n    user_id INT NOT NULL,          -- Foreign key referencing users\n    book_id INT NOT NULL,          -- Foreign key referencing books\n    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5), -- Rating between 1 and 5\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Timestamp for when the review was created\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Timestamp for when the review was last updated\n    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Foreign key constraint for user_id\n    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Foreign key constraint for book_id\n    UNIQUE (user_id, book_id) -- Ensure a user can only review a book once\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation of Schema Components\n\n1. **Users Table**:\n   - `id`: A unique identifier for each user (primary key).\n   - `name`: The name of the user, which cannot be null.\n\n2. **Books Table**:\n   - `id`: A unique identifier for each book (primary key).\n   - `title`: The title of the book, which cannot be null.\n\n3. **Reviews Table**:\n   - `id`: A unique identifier for each review (primary key).\n   - `user_id`: A foreign key referencing the `users` table (must exist in `users`).\n   - `book_id`: A foreign key referencing the `books` table (must exist in `books`).\n   - `rating`: An integer rating between 1 and 5 (inclusive). A check constraint ensures that ratings fall within this range.\n   - `created_at`: A timestamp for when the review was created, defaulting to the current timestamp.\n   - `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the review was last updated, defaulting to the current timestamp and automatically updating on row modification.\n   - Foreign key constraints ensure that reviews cannot exist without corresponding users and books. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` option means that if a user or book is deleted, their associated reviews will also be deleted.\n   - A unique constraint on `(user_id, book_id)` ensures that a user can only leave one review per book.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- You may want to consider adding more fields, such as `text` for the review content, or `helpfulness` ratings for user feedback.\n- Indexes can be added for performance optimization, especially on foreign key fields and frequently queried fields.\n- Depending on your application's requirements, you might also consider additional constraints or relationships, such as a `genres` table or user authentication details.",
        "To design a schema for a review app with users, books, and reviews, we will define three main tables: `users`, `books`, and `reviews`. We will also include primary keys, foreign keys, and relevant constraints to ensure data integrity.\n\nHere\u2019s a schema definition for the app:\n\n### Table: users\n- **id** (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each user.\n- **name** (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Name of the user. This field cannot be null.\n\n### Table: books\n- **id** (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each book.\n- **title** (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Title of the book. This field cannot be null.\n\n### Table: reviews\n- **id** (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each review.\n- **user_id** (INT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `users(id)`. This establishes a relationship between reviews and users. It cannot be null.\n- **book_id** (INT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `books(id)`. This establishes a relationship between reviews and books. It cannot be null.\n- **rating** (INT, CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5), NOT NULL): The rating given by the user for the book, constrained to be between 1 and 5. It cannot be null.\n\n### SQL Schema Definition\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE books (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT NOT NULL,\n    book_id INT NOT NULL,\n    rating INT CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5) NOT NULL,\n    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)  -- Ensures that a user can only review a book once\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation of Constraints:\n1. **Primary Keys**: Each table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each record.\n2. **Foreign Keys**: \n   - `user_id` in the `reviews` table references the `id` in the `users` table, establishing a connection between reviews and users.\n   - `book_id` in the `reviews` table references the `id` in the `books` table, establishing a connection between reviews and books.\n3. **NOT NULL Constraints**: Fields that should not be empty are marked with `NOT NULL`.\n4. **CHECK Constraint**: The `rating` field in the `reviews` table is constrained to ensure that the value is between 1 and 5.\n5. **UNIQUE Constraint**: The combination of `user_id` and `book_id` in the `reviews` table is unique, ensuring that a user can only leave one review per book.\n\nThis schema provides a robust structure for managing users, books, and their associated reviews in a review application."
