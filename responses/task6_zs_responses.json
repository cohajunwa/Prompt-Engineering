        "Here's a proposed schema for a review app with users, books, and reviews. This schema includes appropriate keys and constraints to maintain data integrity and relationships between the tables.\n\n### Schema Design\n\n1. **Users Table**\n   - **Table Name:** `users`\n   - **Columns:**\n     - `id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each user.\n     - `name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Name of the user.\n   - **Constraints:**\n     - `PRIMARY KEY (id)`: Ensures that each user has a unique identifier.\n     - `UNIQUE (name)`: Ensures that no two users can have the same name (if desired; otherwise, this constraint can be omitted).\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE users (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       UNIQUE (name)\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Books Table**\n   - **Table Name:** `books`\n   - **Columns:**\n     - `id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each book.\n     - `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Title of the book.\n   - **Constraints:**\n     - `PRIMARY KEY (id)`: Ensures that each book has a unique identifier.\n     - `UNIQUE (title)`: Ensures that no two books can have the same title (if desired; otherwise, this constraint can be omitted).\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE books (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       UNIQUE (title)\n   );\n   ```\n\n3. **Reviews Table**\n   - **Table Name:** `reviews`\n   - **Columns:**\n     - `id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each review.\n     - `user_id` (INT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing the `users` table.\n     - `book_id` (INT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing the `books` table.\n     - `rating` (TINYINT, NOT NULL): Rating given by the user (e.g., 1 to 5).\n   - **Constraints:**\n     - `PRIMARY KEY (id)`: Ensures that each review has a unique identifier.\n     - `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`: Ensures that the review is linked to a valid user and deletes the review if the user is deleted.\n     - `FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`: Ensures that the review is linked to a valid book and deletes the review if the book is deleted.\n     - `UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)`: Ensures that a user can only leave one review per book.\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE reviews (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       user_id INT NOT NULL,\n       book_id INT NOT NULL,\n       rating TINYINT NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),\n       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n       FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n       UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)\n   );\n   ```\n\n### Summary of Relationships\n- Each user can write multiple reviews but can only review a specific book once.\n- Each book can have multiple reviews from different users.\n- Deleting a user or a book will also delete all related reviews.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- Depending on the application's requirements, you might want to add additional fields such as timestamps for when the review was created or updated, or additional metadata for users and books.\n- Indexes can be added on `user_id` and `book_id` in the `reviews` table for performance improvements when querying."

        "Certainly! Below is a schema design for a review app with users, books, and reviews. This includes appropriate keys and constraints to ensure data integrity and relationships between the tables.\n\n### Schema Design\n\n#### 1. Users Table\nThis table stores information about users.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    UNIQUE (name)\n);\n```\n\n- `id`: A unique identifier for each user. It is a primary key and auto-increments.\n- `name`: The name of the user. It is unique to ensure no duplicate user names.\n\n#### 2. Books Table\nThis table stores information about books.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE books (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    UNIQUE (title)\n);\n```\n\n- `id`: A unique identifier for each book. It is a primary key and auto-increments.\n- `title`: The title of the book. It is unique to ensure no duplicate book titles.\n\n#### 3. Reviews Table\nThis table stores information about reviews, linking users and books.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT NOT NULL,\n    book_id INT NOT NULL,\n    rating INT NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),\n    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)\n);\n```\n\n- `id`: A unique identifier for each review. It is a primary key and auto-increments.\n- `user_id`: The ID of the user who wrote the review. It is a foreign key referencing the `users` table.\n- `book_id`: The ID of the book being reviewed. It is a foreign key referencing the `books` table.\n- `rating`: The rating given to the book. It must be between 1 and 5.\n- `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`: Ensures that if a user is deleted, all their reviews are also deleted.\n- `FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`: Ensures that if a book is deleted, all its reviews are also deleted.\n- `UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)`: Ensures that a user can only write one review per book.\n\n### Summary\n- **users**: Stores user information.\n- **books**: Stores book information.\n- **reviews**: Stores review information, linking users and books with appropriate constraints and relationships.\n\nThis schema ensures data integrity and maintains the relationships between users, books, and reviews effectively."
