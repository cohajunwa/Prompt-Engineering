        "To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps, we can break down the function `process` into the following steps:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define a function named `process` that takes a single integer parameter `x`.\n\n2. **Input Validation**:\n   - Check if the input `x` is less than 0.\n   - If `x` is less than 0, return -1 to indicate that the input is invalid.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - If the input `x` is valid (i.e., it is not less than 0), calculate the square of the input by multiplying `x` by itself (`x * x`).\n\n4. **Return Result**:\n   - Return the calculated square of `x` as the output of the function.\n\nTherefore, the logical steps in the function can be summarized as:\n1. Define the function with an integer parameter.\n2. Check if the input is negative.\n3. If negative, return -1.\n4. If not negative, calculate the square of the input.\n5. Return the squared value.",

        "To decompose the high-level comment/summary of the function `process`, we can break it down into logical steps as follows:\n\n1. **Input Parameter**: The function takes one input parameter, `x`, which is an integer.\n\n2. **Validation Check**: \n   - Check if the input `x` is less than 0.\n   - If `x` is less than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate that the input is invalid.\n\n3. **Calculation**: \n   - If the input `x` is valid (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to 0), the function proceeds to calculate the square of `x`.\n\n4. **Return Result**: \n   - The function returns the result of the square calculation, which is `x * x`.\n\n5. **Output**: The function output is either -1 (for invalid input) or the square of the non-negative input integer `x`.\n\nBy following these steps, we can clearly understand the flow and logic of the function."
