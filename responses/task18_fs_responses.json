        "The function `isEven(n)` is intended to check if a number is even, but it currently returns `1` for odd numbers and `0` for even numbers, which is not equivalent to `true` or `false`. \n\nHere's the fixed code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isEven(n) { \n    return n % 2 === 0; // Returns true for even numbers, false for odd numbers\n}\n```\n\nIn this fixed version, the expression `n % 2 === 0` evaluates to `true` if `n` is even (i.e., the remainder when `n` is divided by `2` is `0`) and `false` if `n` is odd."

        "The bug in the `isEven` function is that it returns `1` or `0` instead of `true` or `false`. To fix this, we need to explicitly compare the result of `n % 2` to `0` and return the appropriate boolean value.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isEven(n) {\n    return n % 2 === 0; // Returns true if n is even, false otherwise\n}\n```\n\nIn this fixed version, the function will correctly return `true` if `n` is even and `false` if `n` is odd."
