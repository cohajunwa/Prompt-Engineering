        "To complete the `calculate_average` function, you can sum up all the scores in the list and then divide that sum by the number of scores to get the average. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(scores): \n    if not scores:  # Check if the list is empty\n        return 0  # Return 0 or you could raise an exception if preferred\n    total = sum(scores)  # Sum all scores\n    average = total / len(scores)  # Calculate average\n    return average  # Return the average\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first checks if the `scores` list is empty. If it is, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero.\n- It then calculates the total by using the `sum()` function.\n- The average is calculated by dividing the total by the number of scores (`len(scores)`).\n- Finally, it returns the calculated average. \n\nYou can test the function with some sample data:\n\n```python\nprint(calculate_average([90, 80, 85, 70]))  # Output: 81.25\nprint(calculate_average([]))  # Output: 0\n```",
        "To complete the `calculate_average` function, you'll want to sum up the scores and then divide by the number of scores to get the average. Here's a complete implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(scores): \n    if not scores:  # Check if the list is empty\n        return 0  # Return 0 or another appropriate value for an empty list\n    \n    total = sum(scores)  # Calculate the total of the scores\n    average = total / len(scores)  # Calculate the average\n    return average  # Return the average\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first checks if the `scores` list is empty. If it is, it returns `0` to avoid division by zero.\n- It then computes the total by using the built-in `sum()` function.\n- Finally, it calculates the average by dividing the total by the number of scores (using `len(scores)`) and returns that value.",
        "To complete the function `calculate_average(scores)` that calculates the average of a list of scores, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total sum of the scores.\n2. Count the number of scores.\n3. Return the average by dividing the total sum by the number of scores.\n4. Handle the case where the list of scores might be empty to avoid division by zero.\n\nHere is the completed function:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(scores): \n    total = sum(scores)  # Calculate the total sum of the scores\n    count = len(scores)  # Get the number of scores\n    \n    # Check to avoid division by zero\n    if count == 0:\n        return 0  # or return None, depending on how you want to handle empty input\n    \n    average = total / count  # Calculate the average\n    return average  # Return the computed average\n```\n\nThis function will now correctly compute the average of the scores passed to it, while also handling the case of an empty list."

        "To complete the `calculate_average` function, you need to iterate through the list of scores, sum them up, and then divide by the number of scores to get the average.
