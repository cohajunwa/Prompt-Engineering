        "The method `countWordFrequency` takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a map (`freqMap`) that contains each unique word from the list as the key and its corresponding frequency (the number of times it appears in the list) as the value. \n\nHere\u2019s a brief breakdown of its functionality:\n\n1. It initializes an empty `HashMap` to store the word frequencies.\n2. It iterates through each word in the provided list.\n3. For each word, it checks if the word is already present in the map:\n   - If it is, it increments the count by 1.\n   - If it is not, it initializes the count to 1.\n4. Finally, it returns the populated frequency map.\n\nIn summary, the method effectively counts how many times each word appears in the input list and returns this information in a map format.",
        "The method `countWordFrequency` takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a map (`freqMap`) that counts the frequency of each unique word in the list. It initializes an empty hash map to store the word counts. For each word in the input list, it updates the map by using the `getOrDefault` method to retrieve the current count of the word (or 0 if the word is not yet in the map) and increments it by 1. Finally, the method returns the populated frequency map, where each key is a unique word and the corresponding value is its frequency in the input list.",
        "The `countWordFrequency` method takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a map (`freqMap`) that represents the frequency of each unique word in the list. It initializes an empty hash map, iterates through each word in the list, and for each word, it updates the count in the map. If the word is already present in the map, its count is incremented; if not, it starts at zero and then increments to one.

        "The `countWordFrequency` method takes a list of strings (words) as input and returns a map where each key is a word from the input list and each value is the frequency count of that word in the list. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of its functionality:\n\n1. **Initialization**: It initializes an empty `HashMap` called `freqMap` to store the frequency of each word.\n\n2. **Iteration**: It iterates over each word in the input list `words`.\n\n3. **Frequency Counting**: For each word, it checks if the word is already a key in the `freqMap`. If it is, it increments the associated value by 1. If it is not, it adds the word to the map with a value of 1 (using `getOrDefault(word, 0)` which returns 0 if the word is not present).\n\n4. **Return**: After iterating through all the words, it returns the `freqMap` containing the word-frequency pairs.\n\nIn summary, the method counts the frequency of each word in the input list and returns a map with these counts.",
        "The `countWordFrequency` method is designed to count the frequency of each word in a given list of strings and return a map where the keys are the words and the values are their respective frequencies.\n\n### Functionality in Detail:\n\n1. **Method Signature**:\n   - The method is public and returns a `Map<String, Integer>`.\n   - It takes a single parameter, a `List<String>`, named `words`.\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - It initializes an empty `HashMap` named `freqMap` to store the words and their frequencies.\n\n3. **Iteration and Frequency Counting**:\n   - The method iterates over each word in the `words` list.\n   - For each word, it updates the `freqMap`:\n     - If the word is already present in the map, it increments its count by 1.\n     - If the word is not present, it adds the word to the map with an initial count of 1.\n   - This is achieved using the `put` method along with the `getOrDefault` function, which retrieves the current count or defaults to 0 if the word is not yet in the map.\n\n4. **Return Value**:\n   - After processing all words in the list, the method returns the `freqMap` containing the frequency count of each word.\n\n### Example:\nGiven the list `[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]`, the method will return:\n```java\n{\n  \"apple\" : 3,\n  \"banana\": 2,\n  \"orange\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis method efficiently counts the occurrences of each word in the input list using a single pass through the list and a hash map for storage, resulting in an O(n) time complexity where n is the number of words in the list.",
