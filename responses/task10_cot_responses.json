        "Let's break down the function `reverse_words(sentence)` step-by-step.\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   The function is defined with the name `reverse_words` and takes a single argument called `sentence`, which is expected to be a string.\n\n2. **Splitting the Sentence**:\n   Inside the function, the method `sentence.split()` is called. The `split()` method, when called without any arguments, splits the string into a list of words based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.). For example, if `sentence` is `\"Hello world\"`, `sentence.split()` would produce the list `[\"Hello\", \"world\"]`.\n\n3. **Reversing the List of Words**:\n   The slicing operation `[::-1]` is applied to the list produced by `split()`. This slice notation means \"take the list and create a new list that is the reverse of the original.\" Continuing with our example, `[\"Hello\", \"world\"][::-1]` would result in `[\"world\", \"Hello\"]`.\n\n4. **Joining the Reversed List**:\n   The `join` method is then called on an empty string `''`, which concatenates the elements of the reversed list into a single string. By default, `join` uses an empty string as the separator, so no spaces will be added between the words. For example, `''.join([\"world\", \"Hello\"])` would produce the string `\"worldHello\"`.\n\n5. **Return Statement**:\n   Finally, the resulting string from the `join` operation is returned as the output of the function.\n\n### Summary:\nThe `reverse_words(sentence)` function takes a string input (`sentence`), splits it into individual words, reverses the order of those words, and then concatenates them into a single string without any spaces between the words. For example, the input `\"Hello world\"` would produce the output `\"worldHello\"`."

        "Let's reason through the function `reverse_words` step-by-step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined with a single parameter `sentence`.\n\n2. **Splitting the Sentence**:\n   ```python\n   sentence.split()\n   ```\n   This line splits the input `sentence` into a list of words. For example, if `sentence` is `\"hello world\"`, `sentence.split()` would result in `['hello', 'world']`.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**:\n   ```python\n   sentence.split()[::-1]\n   ```\n   This part reverses the list of words. For the example above, `['hello', 'world'][::-1]` would result in `['world', 'hello']`.\n\n4. **Joining the Reversed List**:\n   ```python\n   ''.join(sentence.split()[::-1])\n   ```\n   This line joins the reversed list of words back into a single string. The `join` method concatenates the words with nothing between them (i.e., no spaces). For the example, `''.join(['world', 'hello'])` would result in `'worldhello'`.\n\n5. **Returning the Result**:\n   ```python\n   return ''.join(sentence.split()[::-1])\n   ```\n   The function returns the concatenated string.\n\n### Summary\nThe function `reverse_words` takes a sentence as input, splits it into words, reverses the order of the words, and then joins them back into a single string without spaces. The resulting string has the words in reverse order but concatenated together without any spaces in between.\n\nFor example, if the input is `\"hello world\"`, the output will be `\"worldhello\"`."
