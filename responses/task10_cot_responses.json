        "Let's break down the function `reverse_words(sentence)` step-by-step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined with one parameter, `sentence`, which is expected to be a string containing words separated by spaces.\n\n2. **Splitting the Sentence**: Inside the function, `sentence.split()` is called. The `split()` method, when called without any arguments, splits the string into a list of words based on whitespace. For example, if the input is `\"Hello World\"`, this would produce the list `[\"Hello\", \"World\"]`.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**: The slicing notation `[::-1]` is applied to the list of words produced by `split()`. This notation creates a new list that is the reverse of the original list. Continuing the previous example, `[\"Hello\", \"World\"][::-1]` would yield `[\"World\", \"Hello\"]`.\n\n4. **Joining the Reversed List**: The `''.join(...)` method is then called on the reversed list. The `join()` method concatenates the elements of the list into a single string. However, since an empty string `''` is used as the separator, it will concatenate the words without any spaces or other characters in between. For instance, `''.join([\"World\", \"Hello\"])` results in the string `\"WorldHello\"`.\n\n5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns this concatenated string.\n\n### Summary:\nThe function `reverse_words(sentence)` takes a string `sentence` as input, splits it into words, reverses the order of those words, and then joins them back together into a single string without any spaces. For example, the input `\"Hello World\"` would result in the output `\"WorldHello\"`."

        "Let's reason through the function `reverse_words(sentence)` step-by-step:\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The function takes a single argument `sentence`, which is expected to be a string.\n\n2. **Splitting the Sentence**:\n   - `sentence.split()`: This method splits the input string into a list of words. By default, `split()` uses any whitespace as a delimiter.\n\n3. **Reversing the List of Words**:\n   - `[::-1]`: This is a slicing operation that reverses the list. The `[::-1]` slice notation starts from the end of the list and moves backwards, effectively reversing the order of the elements.\n\n4. **Joining the Words**:\n   - `' '.join(...)`: This method joins the reversed list of words back into a single string, with each word separated by a single space.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - The joined string is returned as the output of the function.\n\n### Summary of the Function\n\nThe `reverse_words` function takes a string `sentence`, splits it into individual words, reverses the order of these words, and then joins them back into a single string with spaces between the words. The final result is the reversed sentence.\n\nFor example:\n- Input: `\"hello world how are you\"`\n- Output: `\"you are how world hello\"`\n\nThis function effectively reverses the order of words in a given sentence."
