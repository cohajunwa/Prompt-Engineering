        "The bug in the given `factorial` function is that the loop does not include the last number `n` in the calculation. The `range(1, n)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. Therefore, the factorial calculation is incorrect since it should include `n` itself as part of the multiplication.\n\nTo fix the bug, you should change the range to include `n`. You can do this by using `range(1, n + 1)` instead. Here is the corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Include n in the range\n        result *= i\n    return result\n```\n\nAdditionally, it is a good practice to handle cases where `n` is less than 0, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers. You may also want to add a condition to return 1 when `n` is 0, as the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.\n\nHere is a more robust version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Include n in the range\n        result *= i\n    return result\n```",
        "Here is the corrected version of the `factorial` function with the bug fixed:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Corrected to include n\n        result *= i\n    return result\n```\n\n### Changes made:\n1. Changed the loop from `range(1, n)` to `range(1, n + 1)` to include `n` in the multiplication.\n2. Added a check to raise a `ValueError` if `n` is negative, as factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\nNow the function will correctly compute the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`. For example, `factorial(5)` will return `120`, which is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`."
