If we find the node with the specified key, we unlink it from the list by updating the `next` pointer of the previous node and freeing the memory of the node to be deleted.\n\n5. **Testing**: \n   - The `main` function demonstrates creating a linked list, printing it, deleting nodes, and printing the list again to show the changes. \n\n6. **Memory Management**: \n   - After the operations, we also free any remaining nodes to avoid memory leaks.",
