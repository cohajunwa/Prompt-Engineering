        "To implement a function that deletes a node from a linked list by its value (key), we need to consider several cases:\n\n1. The list is empty.\n2. The node to be deleted is the head of the list.\n3. The node to be deleted is in the middle or at the end of the list.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `deleteNode` function in C:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Define the structure for a node in the linked list\nstruct Node { \n    int data; \n    struct Node* next;\n}; \n\n// Function to delete a node with a specific key\nvoid deleteNode(struct Node** head, int key) { \n    // Check if the list is empty\n    if (*head == NULL) {\n        return; // Nothing to delete\n    }\n    \n    struct Node* temp = *head;\n    struct Node* prev = NULL;\n\n    // Check if the head node itself holds the key to be deleted\n    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {\n        *head = temp->next; // Change the head\n        free(temp); // Free the old head\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Search for the key to be deleted, keep track of the previous node\n    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {\n        prev = temp;\n        temp = temp->next;\n    }\n\n    // If the key was not present in the linked list\n    if (temp == NULL) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Unlink the node from the linked list\n    prev->next = temp->next;\n\n    // Free the memory allocated for the node\n    free(temp);\n}\n\n// Helper function to create a new node\nstruct Node* newNode(int data) {\n    struct Node* node = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));\n    node->data = data;\n    node->next = NULL;\n    return node;\n}\n\n// Helper function to print the linked list\nvoid printList(struct Node* node) {\n    while (node != NULL) {\n        printf(\"%d -> \", node->data);\n        node = node->next;\n    }\n    printf(\"NULL\\n\");\n}\n\n// Example usage\nint main() {\n    struct Node* head = newNode(1);\n    head->next = newNode(2);\n    head->next->next = newNode(3);\n    head->next->next->next = newNode(4);\n    \n    printf(\"Original List: \");\n    printList(head);\n    \n    deleteNode(&head, 3); // Delete node with value 3\n    printf(\"List after deleting 3: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 1); // Delete head node\n    printf(\"List after deleting 1: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 5); // Try to delete a non-existent node\n    printf(\"List after trying to delete 5: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    // Free remaining nodes\n    deleteNode(&head, 2);\n    deleteNode(&head, 4);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `deleteNode` function takes a pointer to the head pointer of the linked list and the key to be deleted.\n- We first check if the list is empty. If it is, we simply return.\n- If the node to delete is the head node, we update the head pointer and free the old head.\n- If the key is not the head, we traverse the list, keeping track of the previous node.\n- Once we find the node containing the key, we unlink it from the list and free its memory.\n- Finally, we have helper functions to create new nodes and print the list, along with an example of how to use the `deleteNode` function.",
        "To implement node deletion by value in a singly linked list, we need to traverse the list, find the node with the given value (key), and then remove it from the list. The following is a C implementation of the `deleteNode` function. This function handles different scenarios, including when the node to be deleted is the head node or when the list is empty.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nstruct Node {\n    int data;\n    struct Node* next;\n};\n\nvoid deleteNode(struct Node** head, int key) {\n    // If the list is empty\n    if (*head == NULL) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    struct Node* temp = *head;\n    struct Node* prev = NULL;\n\n    // If the node to be deleted is the head node\n    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {\n        *head = temp->next; // Change head\n        free(temp);         // Free old head\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Search for the node to be deleted\n    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {\n        prev = temp;\n        temp = temp->next;\n    }\n\n    // If the key was not present in the linked list\n    if (temp == NULL) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Unlink the node from the linked list\n    prev->next = temp->next;\n\n    // Free the memory occupied by the node\n    free(temp);\n}\n\n// Helper function to create a new node\nstruct Node* newNode(int data) {\n    struct Node* node = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));\n    node->data = data;\n    node->next = NULL;\n    return node;\n}\n\n// Helper function to print the linked list\nvoid printList(struct Node* node) {\n    while (node != NULL) {\n        printf(\"%d -> \", node->data);\n        node = node->next;\n    }\n    printf(\"NULL\\n\");\n}\n\n// Example usage\nint main() {\n    struct Node* head = newNode(1);\n    head->next = newNode(2);\n    head->next->next = newNode(3);\n    head->next->next->next = newNode(4);\n\n    printf(\"Original list: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 3);\n    printf(\"After deleting 3: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 1);\n    printf(\"After deleting 1: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 5); // Attempt to delete a non-existing value\n    printf(\"After attempting to delete 5: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    // Free remaining nodes\n    while (head != NULL) {\n        struct Node* temp = head;\n        head = head->next;\n        free(temp);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Declaration:** The `deleteNode` function takes a double pointer to the head of the list and an integer key to identify the node to be deleted.\n\n2. **Empty List Check:** If the list is empty (`*head == NULL`), we simply return.\n\n3. **Head Node Deletion:** If the head node contains the key, we update the head to point to the next node and free the old head.\n\n4. **Traversal and Node Deletion:** We traverse the list using a loop, keeping track of the previous node (`prev`). When we find the node with the key, we unlink it by updating the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the current node. Finally, we free the current node.\n\n5. **Helper Functions:** We have added helper functions to create new nodes and print the linked list for demonstration purposes.\n\n6. **Example Usage:** In the `main` function, we demonstrate the creation of a linked list, deletion of nodes, and printing the list before and after deletions.",
