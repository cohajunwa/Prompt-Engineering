        "The `countWordFrequency` method takes a list of strings (words) as input and returns a map that represents the frequency of each word in the list. It initializes an empty HashMap called `freqMap`. For each word in the input list, it updates the map by either adding the word with a count of 1 if it is not already present or incrementing the existing count by 1 if it is. Finally, it returns the populated frequency map, where the keys are the words and the values are their respective counts."

        "The method `countWordFrequency` takes a list of strings as input and returns a map where the keys are the words from the list, and the values are the frequencies of those words in the list. Here is a step-by-step summary of its functionality:\n\n1. **Input**: A list of strings (`List<String> words`).\n\n2. **Output**: A map (`Map<String, Integer>`) where each key is a word from the input list, and each value is the frequency of that word in the list.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - It initializes an empty `HashMap` named `freqMap` to store the word frequencies.\n   - It iterates over each word in the input list.\n   - For each word, it updates the `freqMap`:\n     - If the word is already in the map, it increments its count by 1.\n     - If the word is not in the map, it adds the word to the map with an initial count of 1.\n   - It returns the `freqMap` after processing all words in the list.\n\nEssentially, this method counts the occurrences of each word in the provided list and stores these counts in a map."
