        "The `countWordFrequency` method takes a list of strings (words) as input and returns a map that contains the frequency count of each word. It does this by iterating through the list of words and using a `HashMap` to store each word as a key and its corresponding count (number of occurrences) as the value. For each word, it updates the count by either initializing it to 1 (if the word is encountered for the first time) or incrementing the existing count by 1. After processing all the words, the method returns the map containing the word frequencies."

        "The provided method `countWordFrequency` is designed to count the frequency of each word in a given list of strings. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of its functionality:\n\n1. **Method Signature**:\n   - The method takes a `List<String>` as input, representing a collection of words.\n   - It returns a `Map<String, Integer>`, where the keys are the words from the input list and the values are the frequencies of those words.\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - An empty `HashMap<String, Integer>` called `freqMap` is created to store the word frequencies.\n\n3. **Iteration and Counting**:\n   - The method iterates over each word in the input list `words`.\n   - For each word, it uses the `put` method of the `freqMap`:\n     - If the word does not exist in the map, `freqMap.getOrDefault(word, 0)` returns `0`.\n     - If the word exists, it returns the current frequency.\n   - The frequency count is incremented by `1` using `+ 1`.\n\n4. **Return Statement**:\n   - After processing all words, the method returns the `freqMap`, which now contains each word from the input list along with its corresponding frequency.\n\n### Example Usage\nIf the input list `words` is `[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]`, the `freqMap` would be:\n```java\n{\n  \"apple\": 3,\n  \"banana\": 2,\n  \"orange\": 1\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\nThe `countWordFrequency` method efficiently counts the occurrences of each word in a list of strings and returns a map where the keys are the words and the values are their respective counts. This is a common operation in text processing and data analysis."
