        "The method `countWordFrequency` takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a map (`freqMap`) that contains the frequency of each word in the list. It initializes an empty hash map, then iterates through each word in the list. For each word, it updates the map by either adding the word with a frequency of 1 (if it\u2019s not already in the map) or incrementing its existing frequency by 1 (if it is). Finally, the method returns the map containing the word frequencies."

        "The method `countWordFrequency` takes a list of strings (`words`) and returns a `Map<String, Integer>` that represents the frequency of each word in the list. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n\n1. **Input**: A list of strings (`List<String> words`).\n\n2. **Initialization**: It initializes an empty `HashMap<String, Integer>` called `freqMap` to store the word frequencies.\n\n3. **Iteration**: It iterates over each string (`word`) in the input list `words`.\n\n4. **Frequency Calculation**:\n   - For each `word`, it checks if the word is already a key in `freqMap`.\n   - If the word is already in the map, it increments its value by 1.\n   - If the word is not in the map, it adds the word to the map with an initial value of 1.\n\n5. **Output**: It returns the `freqMap` containing the frequency of each word in the input list.\n\nIn summary, the method counts how many times each word appears in the list and returns this count in a map where the keys are the words and the values are their respective frequencies."
