        "To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps, we can break down the functionality of the `process` function step-by-step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function is named `process` and takes a single integer parameter `x`.\n\n2. **Validation of Input**:\n   - The first step in the function checks if the input integer `x` is less than 0.\n   - This is done using an `if` statement: `if (x < 0)`.\n   - If `x` is indeed less than 0, the function will immediately return a value of `-1`, indicating that the input is invalid.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Square**:\n   - If the input `x` is not less than 0 (which means `x` is either 0 or a positive integer), the function proceeds to calculate the square of `x`.\n   - This is done with the expression `x * x`.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - The result of the square calculation is then returned as the output of the function.\n\n5. **Summary of Behavior**:\n   - If the input `x` is negative, the function returns `-1`.\n   - If the input `x` is non-negative (0 or positive), the function returns the square of `x`.\n\nOverall, the logical steps in the function can be summarized as follows:\n- Define the function with a parameter.\n- Check if the input is negative and return `-1` if true.\n- Calculate the square of the input if it is non-negative.\n- Return the calculated square."

        "To decompose the high-level comment/summary \"Function that validates an input, calculates square, and returns result\" into logical steps, we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - Define the function `process` that takes an integer `x` as input and returns an integer.\n\n2. **Input Validation**:\n   - Check if the input `x` is less than 0.\n   - If `x` is less than 0, return `-1` to indicate an invalid input.\n\n3. **Square Calculation**:\n   - If the input `x` is not less than 0, calculate the square of `x`.\n\n4. **Return Result**:\n   - Return the calculated square of `x`.\n\nLet's map these logical steps to the given function `process`:\n\n```c\nint process(int x) {\n    if (x < 0) return -1; // Step 2: Input Validation\n    return x * x;         // Step 3: Square Calculation and Step 4: Return Result\n}\n```\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Define the Function**:\n   - The function `process` is defined to take an integer `x` and return an integer.\n\n2. **Input Validation**:\n   - The condition `if (x < 0)` checks if the input `x` is less than 0.\n   - If the condition is true (i.e., `x` is negative), the function returns `-1` immediately.\n\n3. **Square Calculation**:\n   - If the input `x` is not negative, the function proceeds to the next line.\n   - Here, `x * x` calculates the square of `x`.\n\n4. **Return Result**:\n   - The result of `x * x` is returned to the caller of the function.\n\nBy following these logical steps, the function `process` correctly validates the input, calculates the square if the input is valid, and returns the appropriate result."
