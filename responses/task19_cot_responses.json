        "To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps, we need to break down the function `process` into its individual operations and checks. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: \n   - The function is defined to take a single integer parameter `x`.\n   - The return type of the function is `int`.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: \n   - The function checks if the input `x` is less than 0.\n   - If the condition `x < 0` is true, the function immediately returns `-1` to indicate an invalid input.\n\n3. **Calculation**: \n   - If the input `x` is not less than 0 (i.e., it is 0 or positive), the function proceeds to calculate the square of `x`.\n   - This is done using the expression `x * x`.\n\n4. **Return Result**: \n   - The calculated square of `x` is returned as the result of the function.\n\n5. **Summary of Function Behavior**: \n   - The function validates the input to ensure it is non-negative.\n   - It calculates the square of the input if valid.\n   - It returns `-1` for negative inputs and the square for non-negative inputs.\n\nBy following these steps, we clearly understand how the function operates and what it accomplishes."

        "To decompose the high-level comment/summary \"Function that validates an input, calculates square, and returns result\" into logical steps, we can break down the functionality into distinct, sequential operations. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Input Validation:**\n   - Check if the input `x` is less than 0.\n   - If it is, return `-1` to indicate an invalid input.\n\n2. **Square Calculation:**\n   - If the input `x` is not less than 0, calculate the square of `x`.\n\n3. **Return Result:**\n   - Return the calculated square value.\n\nTranslating this into the function `process`, we can implement it as follows:\n\n```c\nint process(int x) {\n    // Step 1: Input Validation\n    if (x < 0) {\n        return -1; // Invalid input\n    }\n\n    // Step 2: Square Calculation\n    int result = x * x;\n\n    // Step 3: Return Result\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Each Step:\n\n1. **Input Validation:**\n   ```c\n   if (x < 0) {\n       return -1;\n   }\n   ```\n   This conditional statement checks if the input `x` is less than 0. If it is, the function returns `-1` to indicate that the input is invalid.\n\n2. **Square Calculation:**\n   ```c\n   int result = x * x;\n   ```\n   If the input is valid (i.e., not less than 0), this line calculates the square of `x` and stores it in the variable `result`.\n\n3. **Return Result:**\n   ```c\n   return result;\n   ```\n   Finally, the function returns the calculated square value stored in `result`.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that each part of the function is clear and follows a logical sequence."
