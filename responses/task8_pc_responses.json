        "The parser you've provided, `parse_csv_line`, is a very basic implementation that uses the `split` method to separate the line into fields based solely on commas. This approach fails to handle quoted fields for several reasons:\n\n1. **Quoted Fields Containing Commas**: In a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, fields can be enclosed in quotes (typically double quotes). If a field contains a comma, the entire field should be treated as a single value. For example, the line:\n   ```\n   \"John Doe\", \"123 Main St, Apt 4\", \"New York\"\n   ```\n   should be parsed into three fields, but the naive splitting would result in four fields because of the comma inside the quoted address.\n\n2. **Escaped Quotes within Fields**: CSV format allows for quotes to be included within quoted fields by escaping them with another quote. For example:\n   ```\n   \"John \"\"Johnny\"\" Doe\"\n   ```\n   This should be interpreted as a single field containing the text `John \"Johnny\" Doe`, but a simple `split` would break it incorrectly.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: There are various edge cases in CSV parsing, such as:\n   - Fields that start or end with quotes.\n   - Empty fields that are represented as `\"\"`.\n   - Newlines within quoted fields.\n   - Mixed use of quotes (e.g., single quotes instead of double quotes).\n\nTo properly handle quoted fields, you would need a more sophisticated approach that can track when you are inside or outside of quotes while parsing the line. This might involve maintaining a state (inside or outside quotes) as you iterate over each character in the line.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a more robust CSV parser that can handle quoted fields:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef parse_csv_line(line):\n    return list(csv.reader([line]))[0]\n```\n\nIn this version, we utilize Python's built-in `csv` module, which correctly handles all the complexities of CSV parsing, including quoted fields, escaped quotes, and more. This is preferred over writing a custom parser from scratch, especially given the potential pitfalls and edge cases of CSV formats.",
        "To improve the CSV parser to handle quoted fields correctly, we can implement a custom parsing function that takes into account the presence of quotes, escaped quotes, and commas within quoted fields. Below is a Python implementation that addresses these issues:\n\n```python\ndef parse_csv_line(line):\n    fields = []\n    current_field = []\n    inside_quotes = False\n\n    for char in line:\n        if char == '\"':\n            # Toggle the inside_quotes state if we encounter a quote\n            inside_quotes = not inside_quotes\n        elif char == ',' and not inside_quotes:\n            # If we encounter a comma and we are not inside quotes, we have a complete field\n            fields.append(''.join(current_field).strip())\n            current_field = []  # Reset for the next field\n        else:\n            # Add the character to the current field\n            current_field.append(char)\n\n    # Add the last field after finishing the loop\n    fields.append(''.join(current_field).strip())\n\n    # Process escaped quotes in fields\n    for i in range(len(fields)):\n        fields[i] = fields[i].replace('\"\"', '\"')  # Unescape double quotes\n\n    return fields\n\n# Example usage\nline = '\"John Doe\", \"123 Main St, Apt 4\", \"New York\"'\nprint(parse_csv_line(line))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `fields` to store the parsed fields, an empty list `current_field` to accumulate characters for the current field, and a boolean `inside_quotes` to track whether we are currently inside a quoted field.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Characters**: We loop through each character in the input `line`.\n   - If we encounter a double quote (`\"`), we toggle the `inside_quotes` state.\n   - If we encounter a comma (`,`), we check if we are not inside quotes. If we are outside quotes, it signifies the end of the current field, so we join the characters in `current_field`, strip any leading/trailing whitespace, and add it to `fields`. We then reset `current_field` for the next field.\n   - If the character is neither a quote nor a comma, we append it to `current_field`.\n\n3. **Add Remaining Field**: After the loop, we add the last field to `fields` since it won\u2019t be followed by a comma.\n\n4. **Handle Escaped Quotes**: Finally, we process each field to replace double quotes (`\"\"`) with a single quote (`\"`), effectively unescaping any quotes that were escaped within the fields.\n\n### Edge Cases:\nThis implementation addresses several edge cases:\n- Fields with commas inside quotes.\n- Fields that contain escaped quotes.\n- Leading and trailing spaces around fields.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the input:\n```python\nline = '\"John Doe\", \"123 Main St, Apt 4\", \"New York\"'\n```\nThe output would be:\n```\n['John Doe', '123 Main St, Apt 4', 'New York']\n```\n\nThis parser should work well for most typical CSV data. However, if you're dealing with CSV data that is particularly complex or non-standard, it may be beneficial to use the built-in `csv` module, which is optimized for handling various CSV formats and edge cases."

        "The provided `parse_csv_line` function does not handle quoted fields because it simply splits the input string by commas using the `split` method.
