        "To implement the node deletion by value in a singly linked list, we need to traverse the list to find the node that contains the specified value (key). Once found, we will adjust the pointers to remove that node from the list. Below is the step-by-step implementation of the `deleteNode` function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If the head is `NULL`, we should return immediately as there is nothing to delete.\n\n2. **Handle deletion of the head node**: If the node to be deleted is the head node (i.e., it matches the key), we need to update the head pointer to the next node.\n\n3. **Traverse the list**: If the node to be deleted is not the head, we need to traverse the list while keeping track of the previous node.\n\n4. **Find the node**: As we traverse, we check if the current node's value matches the key. If it does, we will unlink this node.\n\n5. **Adjust pointers**: If we found the node, update the `next` pointer of the previous node to point to the current node's next node.\n\n6. **Free the node**: Finally, we should free the memory of the deleted node.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above logic in C:\n\n```c\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct Node { \n    int data; \n    struct Node* next;\n}; \n\nvoid deleteNode(struct Node** head, int key) { \n    // Step 1: Check if the list is empty\n    if (*head == NULL) {\n        printf(\"The list is empty.\\n\");\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    struct Node* temp = *head; // Temporary pointer to traverse the list\n    struct Node* prev = NULL; // Pointer to keep track of the previous node\n\n    // Step 2: Check if the head node is the one to be deleted\n    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {\n        *head = temp->next; // Change head\n        free(temp); // Free old head\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Step 3: Traverse the list to find the node to be deleted\n    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {\n        prev = temp; // Update previous node\n        temp = temp->next; // Move to the next node\n    }\n\n    // Step 4: If the key was not present in the list\n    if (temp == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Node with value %d not found.\\n\", key);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Step 5: Unlink the node from linked list\n    prev->next = temp->next;\n\n    // Step 6: Free the memory of the deleted node\n    free(temp);\n}\n\nvoid printList(struct Node* node) {\n    while (node != NULL) {\n        printf(\"%d -> \", node->data);\n        node = node->next;\n    }\n    printf(\"NULL\\n\");\n}\n\n// Function to create a new node\nstruct Node* newNode(int data) {\n    struct Node* new_node = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));\n    new_node->data = data;\n    new_node->next = NULL;\n    return new_node;\n}\n\n// Example usage\nint main() {\n    struct Node* head = newNode(1);\n    head->next = newNode(2);\n    head->next->next = newNode(3);\n    head->next->next->next = newNode(4);\n\n    printf(\"Original list: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 3);\n    printf(\"After deleting 3: \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 1);\n    printf(\"After deleting 1 (head): \");\n    printList(head);\n\n    deleteNode(&head, 5); // Trying to delete a non-existent node\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Node Structure**: We define a `Node` structure with an integer data field and a pointer to the next node.\n- **deleteNode Function**: This function implements the logic described above to delete a node by its value.\n- **Memory Management**: We use `malloc` to allocate memory for new nodes and `free` to deallocate memory when a node is deleted.\n- **Print Function**: The `printList` function is for displaying the contents of the list.\n- **Example Usage**: In the `main` function, we create a linked list, print it, delete nodes, and print the list again to show the results.\n\nThis implementation handles the deletion of nodes in a singly linked list effectively, while also managing memory appropriately."
