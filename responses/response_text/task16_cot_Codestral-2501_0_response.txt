Sure, I can help you complete the binary search implementation. Here's the step-by-step process to compare and adjust the bounds:

1. **Compare the middle element with the target**:
   - If the middle element is equal to the target, return the index of the middle element.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, it must be in the left half of the array.
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, it must be in the right half of the array.

2. **Adjust the bounds**:
   - If the target is in the left half, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - If the target is in the right half, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.

Here's the complete implementation:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;

        // Compare the middle element with the target
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;  // Target found
        } else if (target < arr[mid]) {
            right = mid - 1;  // Target is in the left half
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;  // Target is in the right half
        }
    }

    return -1;  // Target not found
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `left` is set to the start of the array, and `right` is set to the end of the array.
- **Loop Condition**: Continue the loop as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- **Mid Calculation**: Calculate the middle index `mid`.
- **Comparison**:
  - If `arr[mid]` is equal to the `target`, return `mid`.
  - If `target` is less than `arr[mid]`, adjust `right` to `mid - 1`.
  - If `target` is greater than `arr[mid]`, adjust `left` to `mid + 1`.
- **Return**: If the loop ends without finding the target, return `-1`.

This implementation ensures that the binary search is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
