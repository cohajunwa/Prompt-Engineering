To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps, we can break down the function `process` into the following steps:

1. **Function Definition**: Define a function named `process` that takes an integer parameter `x`.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Check if the input `x` is less than 0.
   - If `x` is less than 0, return -1 to indicate that the input is invalid.

3. **Calculation**:
   - If the input `x` is valid (i.e., not less than 0), calculate the square of `x` (i.e., `x * x`).

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the result of the square calculation.

Putting it all together, the function processes the input by validating it, performing a calculation if valid, and returning the appropriate result.
