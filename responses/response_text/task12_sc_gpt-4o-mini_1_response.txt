The issue with your `factorial` function arises when the input is 0. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1, but your current implementation does not handle this case correctly. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Change range to include n
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Handle the case for 0**: The loop now runs from 1 to `n + 1`, so when `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `result` will remain 1, which is the correct value for `0!`.
2. **Added error handling**: A check for negative numbers is included, raising a `ValueError` if `n` is negative, since factorial is not defined for negative integers.

Now the function will return the correct factorial for all non-negative integers. Here are some example outputs:

```python
print(factorial(0))  # Output: 1
print(factorial(1))  # Output: 1
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```
