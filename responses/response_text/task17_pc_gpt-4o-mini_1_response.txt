To resolve the inconsistency in the function, we can choose one of the two options presented earlier. Here, I will provide both options for clarity, and you can select the one that fits your needs.

### Option 1: Rename the function to check for even numbers

If the intention is to determine whether a number is even, you can rename the function as follows:

```cpp
bool isEven(int x) { 
    return x % 2 == 0; 
}
```

### Option 2: Change the logic to check for odd numbers

If the intention is to determine whether a number is odd, you can adjust the logic while keeping the original function name:

```cpp
bool isOdd(int x) { 
    return x % 2 != 0; 
}
```

Choose the option that best reflects the intended functionality of your program. If you want to check if a number is even, use Option 1. If you want to check if a number is odd, use Option 2.
