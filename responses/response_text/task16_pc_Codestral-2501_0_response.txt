The provided binary search implementation has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Target Comparison**: The code does not compare the middle element with the target to determine whether to continue searching in the left or right half.
2. **Missing Adjustment of `left` and `right`**: The code does not adjust the `left` and `right` pointers based on the comparison.
3. **Return Statement Placement**: The return statement is placed outside the loop, which means it will always return `-1` if the loop completes without finding the target.

Here is the corrected version of the binary search implementation:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Target found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Search in the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Search in the left half
        }
    }
    return -1; // Target not found
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Target Comparison**: Inside the loop, the middle element (`arr[mid]`) is compared with the target.
   - If `arr[mid] == target`, the target is found, and the index `mid` is returned.
   - If `arr[mid] < target`, it means the target must be in the right half, so `left` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid] > target`, it means the target must be in the left half, so `right` is updated to `mid - 1`.

2. **Adjustment of `left` and `right`**: The pointers `left` and `right` are adjusted based on the comparison to narrow down the search range.

3. **Return Statement Placement**: The return statement `-1` is placed outside the loop to indicate that the target was not found if the loop completes without finding the target.

This ensures that the binary search algorithm correctly finds the target element or determines that it is not present in the array.
