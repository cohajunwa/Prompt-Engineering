To complete the `calculate_average` function, you need to iterate through the list of scores, sum them up, and then divide by the number of scores to get the average. Here's the complete function:

```python
def calculate_average(scores):
    if not scores:  # Check if the list is empty
        return 0

    total = sum(scores)  # Sum all the scores
    count = len(scores)  # Count the number of scores
    average = total / count  # Calculate the average
    return average
```

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the function:

1. **Check for an empty list**: If the `scores` list is empty, returning 0 is a reasonable default value.
2. **Sum the scores**: Use the `sum()` function to calculate the total of all scores in the list.
3. **Count the scores**: Use the `len()` function to determine the number of scores in the list.
4. **Calculate the average**: Divide the total sum by the count of scores to get the average.
5. **Return the average**: Return the calculated average.

You can test this function with a sample list of scores:

```python
scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
print(calculate_average(scores))  # Output should be 86.2
```

This function should work correctly for any list of numerical scores.
