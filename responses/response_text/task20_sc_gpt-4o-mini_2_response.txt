To complete the function `calculate_average(scores)` that calculates the average of a list of scores, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of the scores.
2. Count the number of scores.
3. Return the average by dividing the total sum by the number of scores.
4. Handle the case where the list of scores might be empty to avoid division by zero.

Here is the completed function:

```python
def calculate_average(scores): 
    total = sum(scores)  # Calculate the total sum of the scores
    count = len(scores)  # Get the number of scores
    
    # Check to avoid division by zero
    if count == 0:
        return 0  # or return None, depending on how you want to handle empty input
    
    average = total / count  # Calculate the average
    return average  # Return the computed average
```

This function will now correctly compute the average of the scores passed to it, while also handling the case of an empty list.
