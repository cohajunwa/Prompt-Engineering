To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps, we can break down the function's purpose and the operations it performs. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - Define a function named `process` that takes an integer parameter `x`.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Check if the input `x` is less than 0.
     - If `x` is less than 0, return `-1` to indicate an invalid input.

3. **Calculation**:
   - If the input is valid (i.e., `x` is 0 or greater), calculate the square of `x` (i.e., compute `x * x`).

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the calculated square of `x`.

By following these steps, the function ensures that it validates the input, performs the calculation if valid, and returns the appropriate result.
