The provided utility script has several potential logic issues, design flaws, and style problems that can be improved for better readability, correctness, and safety. Here are the key areas of concern:

### Potential Issues and Design Flaws:

1. **File Handling**: The script does not handle exceptions that may arise while opening or reading the CSV file. This could lead to crashes if the file does not exist or is not accessible.

2. **Data Parsing**: The script assumes that all values in the specified column can be converted to `float`, which may not always be the case. If the value is not numeric, it will raise a `ValueError`.

3. **Hardcoded File Path**: The file path is hardcoded, making it less flexible. It would be better to allow the user to specify the file path as a command line argument.

4. **Magic Numbers**: The column index used in `summarize_column` is hardcoded to `1`, which makes the function less reusable. It should be passed as an argument.

5. **CSV Reader**: The script does not handle different delimiters or quote characters, which might be necessary for various CSV formats.

6. **Improper Indentation and Syntax**: The indentation of the `return` statement in `read_csv` is incorrect, which will lead to a syntax error. Additionally, the quotation marks used for `filepath` and the `if __name__` check are not standard.

7. **Division by Zero**: The `summarize_column` function does not check if `values` is empty before calculating the average. This can lead to a division by zero error.

### Refactored Code:

Here is a refactored version of the script that addresses the identified issues:

```python
import csv
import os
import sys

def read_csv(filepath):
    """Read a CSV file and return its contents as a list of rows."""
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file {filepath} does not exist.")
    
    with open(filepath, 'r', newline='') as f:
        return [row for row in csv.reader(f)]

def summarize_column(data, index):
    """Calculate the total and average of a specified column in the data."""
    try:
        values = [float(row[index]) for row in data[1:]]  # Skip header
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Non-numeric data found in column {index}: {e}")

    if not values:
        raise ValueError("No numeric data found in the specified column.")

    total = sum(values)
    avg = total / len(values)
    return total, avg

def main(filepath, column_index):
    """Main function to read a CSV file and summarize a column."""
    data = read_csv(filepath)
    total, avg = summarize_column(data, column_index)
    print("Total:", total)
    print("Average:", avg)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python utils.py <filepath> <column_index>")
        sys.exit(1)

    filepath = sys.argv[1]
    try:
        column_index = int(sys.argv[2])
    except ValueError:
        print("Column index must be an integer.")
        sys.exit(1)

    main(filepath, column_index)
```

### Improvements Made:

1. **Error Handling**: Added error handling for file access and non-numeric data.
2. **Dynamic File Input**: The script now accepts the file path and column index as command-line arguments, enhancing flexibility.
3. **Magic Numbers Removed**: The column index is now passed as an argument.
4. **CSV Reader Improvements**: While this version does not explicitly handle different delimiters, the CSV module can be configured as needed.
5. **Division by Zero Check**: The code checks if `values` is empty before calculating the average.
6. **Improved Readability**: Added docstrings and improved variable names for clarity.
