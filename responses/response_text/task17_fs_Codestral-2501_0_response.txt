The inconsistency in the function `isOdd` is that the logic checks if `x` is even rather than odd. To resolve this, the function should check if `x` is odd. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```cpp
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0; // Logic corrected to check if x is odd
}
```

In this corrected version, the function `isOdd` correctly returns `true` if `x` is odd and `false` otherwise.
