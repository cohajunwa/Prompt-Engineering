The method `countWordFrequency` takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a map (`freqMap`) that contains the frequency of each word in the list. It initializes an empty hash map, then iterates through each word in the list. For each word, it updates the map by either adding the word with a frequency of 1 (if itâ€™s not already in the map) or incrementing its existing frequency by 1 (if it is). Finally, the method returns the map containing the word frequencies.
