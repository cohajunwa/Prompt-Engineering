The inconsistency between the function name and the logic in the provided code is that the function is named `isOdd`, but it actually returns `true` if `x` is even, rather than if `x` is odd.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```cpp
bool isEven(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

If you specifically need a function to check if a number is odd, you should adjust the function name and the logic accordingly:

```cpp
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, `isOdd` returns `true` if `x` is odd, and `isEven` returns `true` if `x` is even.
