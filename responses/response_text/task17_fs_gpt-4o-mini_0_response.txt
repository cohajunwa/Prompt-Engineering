To resolve the inconsistency between the function name and the logic in the provided code, we need to change the function logic so that it correctly determines if a number is odd. The original function is named `isOdd` but incorrectly checks if the number is even. 

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```cpp
// Fix:
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0; // Now correctly checks if x is odd
}
```

In this corrected function, we use the condition `x % 2 != 0` to determine if `x` is odd, which aligns the logic with the function name.
