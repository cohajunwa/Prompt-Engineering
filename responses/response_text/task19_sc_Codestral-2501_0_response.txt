To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps for the function `process`, follow these steps:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Check if the input `x` is less than 0.
   - If `x` is less than 0, return `-1`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - If `x` is not less than 0, calculate the square of `x` (i.e., `x * x`).

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the calculated square of `x`.

Here is the function with the decomposed steps:

```c
int process(int x) {
    // Step 1: Input Validation
    if (x < 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Step 2: Calculation
    int result = x * x;

    // Step 3: Return Result
    return result;
}
```

This decomposition makes the function logic clearer and easier to understand.
