The type of bug in the provided C++ function is a **dangling pointer** issue. 

### Explanation:
- In the function `getArray`, an array `arr` is created with a size determined by the parameter `size`. This array is allocated on the stack because it is a local variable.
- When the function returns, the local variable `arr` goes out of scope, and the memory allocated for it is no longer valid. Therefore, returning a pointer to this local array means that the caller will receive a pointer to memory that has been deallocated when the function exits.
- As a result, any attempt to access this pointer after the function returns leads to undefined behavior, as it points to a location in memory that is no longer reserved for the array.

To fix this issue, you can allocate the array on the heap using `new` and ensure that the caller is responsible for freeing the memory with `delete[]`:

```cpp
int* getArray(int size) {
    int* arr = new int[size]; // Allocate on the heap
    return arr; // Now it's safe to return the pointer
}
```

Remember to free the allocated memory in the calling code to avoid memory leaks:

```cpp
int* myArray = getArray(10);
// Use myArray
delete[] myArray; // Free the memory
```
