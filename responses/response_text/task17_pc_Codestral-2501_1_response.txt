To resolve the inconsistency, you need to ensure that the function name accurately reflects the logic it implements. If the goal is to check if a number is odd, the function name should be `isOdd` and the logic should return `true` when the number is odd.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```cpp
// Returns true if x is odd
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0;
}
```

If the goal is to check if a number is even, the function name should be `isEven` and the logic should return `true` when the number is even:

```cpp
// Returns true if x is even
bool isEven(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

Choose the correct version based on the intended functionality. If you need both functionalities, you can define two separate functions:

```cpp
// Returns true if x is odd
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0;
}

// Returns true if x is even
bool isEven(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

This ensures that the function name and the logic are consistent and accurately represent what the functions do.
