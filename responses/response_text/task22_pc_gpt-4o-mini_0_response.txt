The script you provided has a few issues that need to be addressed. Here's a breakdown of what's wrong:

1. **Incomplete `clean_line` function**: 
   - The `clean_line` function is currently a placeholder (using `pass`). It should remove punctuation and convert text to lowercase. You need to implement this functionality.

2. **Indentation error in `count_words` function**: 
   - The line `clean = clean_line(line)` is not properly indented. It should be indented to be inside the `for line in lines:` loop.

3. **Incorrect string quotation marks in `if __name__` statement**: 
   - The quotation marks used around `'__main__'` are not standard single quotes. They appear to be typographic quotes (’ and ‘). They should be replaced with standard single quotes (').

Here’s a corrected version of the script addressing the above issues:

```python
# file_processor.py - Complete script for processing text files 

import string 

def load_file(filepath): 
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f: 
        return f.readlines() 

def clean_line(line): 
    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase 
    line = line.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))  # Remove punctuation
    return line.lower().strip()  # Convert to lowercase and strip whitespace 

def count_words(lines): 
    word_counts = {} 
    for line in lines: 
        clean = clean_line(line)  # Correctly indented
        for word in clean.split(): 
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1 
    return word_counts 

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt' 
    lines = load_file(filepath) 
    counts = count_words(lines) 
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()): 
        print(f"{word}: {count}") 

if __name__ == '__main__':  # Corrected quotation marks
    main()
```

### Summary of Fixes:
- Implemented the `clean_line` function to remove punctuation and convert text to lowercase.
- Corrected indentation in the `count_words` function.
- Fixed the quotation marks in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement.
