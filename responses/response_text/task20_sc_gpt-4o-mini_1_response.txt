To complete the `calculate_average` function, you'll want to sum up the scores and then divide by the number of scores to get the average. Here's a complete implementation:

```python
def calculate_average(scores): 
    if not scores:  # Check if the list is empty
        return 0  # Return 0 or another appropriate value for an empty list
    
    total = sum(scores)  # Calculate the total of the scores
    average = total / len(scores)  # Calculate the average
    return average  # Return the average
```

### Explanation:
- The function first checks if the `scores` list is empty. If it is, it returns `0` to avoid division by zero.
- It then computes the total by using the built-in `sum()` function.
- Finally, it calculates the average by dividing the total by the number of scores (using `len(scores)`) and returns that value.
