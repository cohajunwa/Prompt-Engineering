To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps, we need to break down the function `process` into its individual operations and checks. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function is defined to take a single integer parameter `x`.
   - The return type of the function is `int`.

2. **Input Validation**: 
   - The function checks if the input `x` is less than 0.
   - If the condition `x < 0` is true, the function immediately returns `-1` to indicate an invalid input.

3. **Calculation**: 
   - If the input `x` is not less than 0 (i.e., it is 0 or positive), the function proceeds to calculate the square of `x`.
   - This is done using the expression `x * x`.

4. **Return Result**: 
   - The calculated square of `x` is returned as the result of the function.

5. **Summary of Function Behavior**: 
   - The function validates the input to ensure it is non-negative.
   - It calculates the square of the input if valid.
   - It returns `-1` for negative inputs and the square for non-negative inputs.

By following these steps, we clearly understand how the function operates and what it accomplishes.
