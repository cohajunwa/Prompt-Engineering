Sure, let's complete the script step by step.

### Step 1: Complete the `clean_line` Function

The `clean_line` function should remove punctuation and convert the line to lowercase. We can use the `str.translate` method along with `str.maketrans` to remove punctuation.

Here is the updated `clean_line` function:

```python
def clean_line(line):
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    return line.translate(translator).lower()
```

### Step 2: Fix the `count_words` Function

The `count_words` function should call `clean_line` for each line and then split the cleaned line into words. We also need to make sure we properly handle the cleaned line.

Here is the updated `count_words` function:

```python
def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts
```

### Step 3: Fix the `main` Function

The `main` function should correctly call the `count_words` function and print the word counts. We need to fix the indentation and ensure that the `filepath` is correctly specified.

Here is the updated `main` function:

```python
def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

### Complete Script

Here is the complete script with all the updates:

```python
# file_processor.py - Complete script for processing text files

import string

def load_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.readlines()

def clean_line(line):
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    return line.translate(translator).lower()

def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **`load_file` Function**: Reads the file and returns a list of lines.
2. **`clean_line` Function**: Removes punctuation and converts the line to lowercase.
3. **`count_words` Function**: Cleans each line and counts the frequency of each word.
4. **`main` Function**: Loads the file, counts the words, and prints the word frequencies.

Now, you can run this script with an input file named `input.txt` and it will clean the text, remove punctuation, count the word frequencies, and print the results.
