To complete the recursive function for the Fibonacci sequence, we'll follow a step-by-step approach by first defining the base cases and then the recursive call.

### Step 1: Define the Base Cases

In the Fibonacci sequence, the base cases are:
- `fibonacci(0)` should return `0` (the 0th Fibonacci number).
- `fibonacci(1)` should return `1` (the 1st Fibonacci number).

### Step 2: Implement the Recursive Call

For `n > 1`, the Fibonacci number can be calculated using the formula:
- `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)`

### Step 3: Combine Both Parts

Now we can combine the base cases and the recursive call into the function.

Here's the complete implementation of the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive call
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `fibonacci` takes an integer `n` as input.
- It first checks if `n` is `0` or `1`. If so, it returns `0` or `1`, respectively.
- For any value of `n` greater than `1`, it makes a recursive call to calculate the Fibonacci number by summing the results of `fibonacci(n - 1)` and `fibonacci(n - 2)`.

### Example Usage

You can call this function to get Fibonacci numbers:

```python
print(fibonacci(0))  # Output: 0
print(fibonacci(1))  # Output: 1
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(10)) # Output: 55
```

### Note

While this implementation is correct, it is not efficient for large `n` because it recalculates Fibonacci numbers multiple times. For larger inputs, consider using memoization or an iterative approach to optimize it.
