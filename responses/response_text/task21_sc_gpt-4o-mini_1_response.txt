The provided utility script has several logic issues, design flaws, and readability concerns. Below, I will identify these issues and then refactor the code.

### Issues and Flaws:
1. **Indentation Error in `read_csv`:** The return statement in the `read_csv` function is incorrectly indented, which will cause a syntax error.
2. **File Path Issues:** The file path string uses incorrect quote characters and has unnecessary spaces which could lead to a file not found error.
3. **Error Handling:** There is no error handling for file operations or data parsing. This can lead to unhandled exceptions if the file doesn't exist, is empty, or contains non-numeric data.
4. **Assumption of Column Existence:** The script assumes that the specified index will always exist and contain valid numeric data.
5. **Magic Numbers:** The column index (1) is hardcoded, making the code less flexible and harder to maintain.
6. **Missing Documentation:** The functions lack docstrings, making it difficult to understand their purpose and usage.
7. **Data Type Assumptions:** The script assumes that all values in the specified column are numeric, which may not always be true.
8. **Use of Global Variables:** The script utilizes a hard-coded file path, which is not flexible for different datasets.

### Refactored Code:
Hereâ€™s a refactored version of the script that addresses the issues mentioned above:

```python
import csv
import os

def read_csv(filepath):
    """Reads a CSV file and returns its content as a list of rows."""
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file {filepath} does not exist.")
    
    with open(filepath, 'r', newline='') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        data = list(reader)
        
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("The CSV file is empty.")
    
    return data

def summarize_column(data, index):
    """Calculates the total and average of numeric values in the specified column."""
    if index < 0 or index >= len(data[0]):
        raise IndexError(f"Column index {index} out of range.")
    
    try:
        values = [float(row[index]) for row in data[1:]]  # Skip header
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Non-numeric data found in column {index}: {e}")

    if not values:
        raise ValueError("No valid numeric data in the specified column.")

    total = sum(values)
    avg = total / len(values)
    
    return total, avg

def main(filepath='data.csv', column_index=1):
    """Main function to read CSV and summarize a specified column."""
    data = read_csv(filepath)
    total, avg = summarize_column(data, column_index)
    
    print(f"Total: {total}")
    print(f"Average: {avg}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Improvements Made:
1. **Fixed Indentation Error:** Correctly indented `return` statement in `read_csv`.
2. **Error Handling:** Added checks for file existence, empty files, and invalid indices. Added exception handling for non-numeric data.
3. **Parameterization:** Made the file path and column index parameters of the `main` function for greater flexibility.
4. **Documentation:** Added docstrings to each function for better understanding.
5. **Readability:** Improved code readability by following PEP 8 style guidelines (e.g., spacing, line lengths).
6. **Safety:** The code now safely handles unexpected situations, providing informative error messages to the user.
