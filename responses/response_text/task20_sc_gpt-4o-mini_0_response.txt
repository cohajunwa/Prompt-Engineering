To complete the `calculate_average` function, you can sum up all the scores in the list and then divide that sum by the number of scores to get the average. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
def calculate_average(scores): 
    if not scores:  # Check if the list is empty
        return 0  # Return 0 or you could raise an exception if preferred
    total = sum(scores)  # Sum all scores
    average = total / len(scores)  # Calculate average
    return average  # Return the average
```

### Explanation:
- The function first checks if the `scores` list is empty. If it is, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero.
- It then calculates the total by using the `sum()` function.
- The average is calculated by dividing the total by the number of scores (`len(scores)`).
- Finally, it returns the calculated average. 

You can test the function with some sample data:

```python
print(calculate_average([90, 80, 85, 70]))  # Output: 81.25
print(calculate_average([]))  # Output: 0
```
