The parser you've provided, `parse_csv_line`, is a very basic implementation that uses the `split` method to separate the line into fields based solely on commas. This approach fails to handle quoted fields for several reasons:

1. **Quoted Fields Containing Commas**: In a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, fields can be enclosed in quotes (typically double quotes). If a field contains a comma, the entire field should be treated as a single value. For example, the line:
   ```
   "John Doe", "123 Main St, Apt 4", "New York"
   ```
   should be parsed into three fields, but the naive splitting would result in four fields because of the comma inside the quoted address.

2. **Escaped Quotes within Fields**: CSV format allows for quotes to be included within quoted fields by escaping them with another quote. For example:
   ```
   "John ""Johnny"" Doe"
   ```
   This should be interpreted as a single field containing the text `John "Johnny" Doe`, but a simple `split` would break it incorrectly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: There are various edge cases in CSV parsing, such as:
   - Fields that start or end with quotes.
   - Empty fields that are represented as `""`.
   - Newlines within quoted fields.
   - Mixed use of quotes (e.g., single quotes instead of double quotes).

To properly handle quoted fields, you would need a more sophisticated approach that can track when you are inside or outside of quotes while parsing the line. This might involve maintaining a state (inside or outside quotes) as you iterate over each character in the line.

Hereâ€™s an example of a more robust CSV parser that can handle quoted fields:

```python
import csv

def parse_csv_line(line):
    return list(csv.reader([line]))[0]
```

In this version, we utilize Python's built-in `csv` module, which correctly handles all the complexities of CSV parsing, including quoted fields, escaped quotes, and more. This is preferred over writing a custom parser from scratch, especially given the potential pitfalls and edge cases of CSV formats.
