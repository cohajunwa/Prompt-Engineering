To complete the binary search implementation, we need to compare the middle element (`arr[mid]`) with the `target` value. Based on the comparison, we will adjust the bounds (`left` and `right`) accordingly. Here’s how to do this step-by-step:

1. If the middle element is equal to the target, we have found the target, and we can return the index `mid`.
2. If the middle element is less than the target, it means the target must be in the right half of the array, so we adjust `left` to `mid + 1`.
3. If the middle element is greater than the target, it means the target must be in the left half of the array, so we adjust `right` to `mid - 1`.

Here’s the complete code for the binary search implementation:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) { 
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1; 
    while (left <= right) { 
        int mid = (left + right) / 2; 
        
        // Compare the middle element with the target
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Target found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Adjust bounds to search in the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Adjust bounds to search in the left half
        }
    }
    return -1; // Target not found
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- `int mid = (left + right) / 2;` calculates the middle index.
- The first `if` statement checks if the middle element is the target. If it is, the index `mid` is returned.
- The second `else if` checks if the middle element is less than the target. If it is, we know that the target must be on the right side, so we move the `left` boundary to `mid + 1`.
- The final `else` handles the case where the middle element is greater than the target, adjusting the `right` boundary to `mid - 1`.
- If the loop exits without finding the target, `-1` is returned to indicate that the target is not in the array.
