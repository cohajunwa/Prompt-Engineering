Certainly! Here is the corrected version of the `factorial` function that includes the necessary fixes:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    result = 1 
    for i in range(1, n + 1): 
        result *= i 
    return result
```

### Changes made:
1. **Range Adjustment**: Changed `range(1, n)` to `range(1, n + 1)` to ensure that the loop includes `n` in the calculation.
2. **Error Handling**: Added a check to raise a `ValueError` if `n` is negative, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.

Now, the function correctly calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`. For example, `factorial(5)` will return `120`, which is `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.
