The current implementation of the `factorial` function does not handle the case when the input is `0`. By definition, the factorial of `0` is `1`. 

To fix this bug, you can add a condition to check if `n` is `0`. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    result = 1 
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Update range to include n
        result *= i 
    return result
```

### Changes made:
1. Added a check for when `n` is `0` to return `1`.
2. Changed the range in the `for` loop to `range(1, n + 1)` so that it includes `n` in the multiplication.

Now the function will correctly return `1` for `factorial(0)` and compute the factorial for positive integers as expected.
