The `countWordFrequency` method takes a list of strings (words) as input and returns a map where each unique word is a key and its corresponding value is the number of times that word appears in the list. It initializes an empty hash map to store the word frequencies. As it iterates through each word in the list, it updates the map by using the `getOrDefault` method to either retrieve the current count of the word (or 0 if it doesn't exist) and then increments that count by 1. Finally, the method returns the populated frequency map.
