The bug in the `isEven` function is that it returns `1` or `0` instead of `true` or `false`. In JavaScript, `1` is truthy and `0` is falsy, but for clarity and explicitness, it's often better to return `true` or `false` directly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```javascript
function isEven(n) {
    return n % 2 === 0; // Returns true if n is even, false otherwise
}
```

This way, the function explicitly returns a boolean value, making its intent clearer.
