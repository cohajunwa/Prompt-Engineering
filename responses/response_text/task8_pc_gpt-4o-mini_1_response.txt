To improve the CSV parser to handle quoted fields correctly, we can implement a custom parsing function that takes into account the presence of quotes, escaped quotes, and commas within quoted fields. Below is a Python implementation that addresses these issues:

```python
def parse_csv_line(line):
    fields = []
    current_field = []
    inside_quotes = False

    for char in line:
        if char == '"':
            # Toggle the inside_quotes state if we encounter a quote
            inside_quotes = not inside_quotes
        elif char == ',' and not inside_quotes:
            # If we encounter a comma and we are not inside quotes, we have a complete field
            fields.append(''.join(current_field).strip())
            current_field = []  # Reset for the next field
        else:
            # Add the character to the current field
            current_field.append(char)

    # Add the last field after finishing the loop
    fields.append(''.join(current_field).strip())

    # Process escaped quotes in fields
    for i in range(len(fields)):
        fields[i] = fields[i].replace('""', '"')  # Unescape double quotes

    return fields

# Example usage
line = '"John Doe", "123 Main St, Apt 4", "New York"'
print(parse_csv_line(line))
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `fields` to store the parsed fields, an empty list `current_field` to accumulate characters for the current field, and a boolean `inside_quotes` to track whether we are currently inside a quoted field.

2. **Iterate Through Characters**: We loop through each character in the input `line`.
   - If we encounter a double quote (`"`), we toggle the `inside_quotes` state.
   - If we encounter a comma (`,`), we check if we are not inside quotes. If we are outside quotes, it signifies the end of the current field, so we join the characters in `current_field`, strip any leading/trailing whitespace, and add it to `fields`. We then reset `current_field` for the next field.
   - If the character is neither a quote nor a comma, we append it to `current_field`.

3. **Add Remaining Field**: After the loop, we add the last field to `fields` since it wonâ€™t be followed by a comma.

4. **Handle Escaped Quotes**: Finally, we process each field to replace double quotes (`""`) with a single quote (`"`), effectively unescaping any quotes that were escaped within the fields.

### Edge Cases:
This implementation addresses several edge cases:
- Fields with commas inside quotes.
- Fields that contain escaped quotes.
- Leading and trailing spaces around fields.

### Example Output:
For the input:
```python
line = '"John Doe", "123 Main St, Apt 4", "New York"'
```
The output would be:
```
['John Doe', '123 Main St, Apt 4', 'New York']
```

This parser should work well for most typical CSV data. However, if you're dealing with CSV data that is particularly complex or non-standard, it may be beneficial to use the built-in `csv` module, which is optimized for handling various CSV formats and edge cases.
