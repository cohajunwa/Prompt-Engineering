The provided utility script has several potential logic issues and design flaws that could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results. Below is a breakdown of these issues, followed by a refactored version of the script for improved readability, correctness, and safety.

### Issues Identified

1. **Indentation Error**: The `return` statement in the `read_csv` function is incorrectly indented, which will lead to an `IndentationError`.
   
2. **File Handling**: The file is opened without handling potential errors (e.g., file not found, permission denied).

3. **Inconsistent Quote Types**: The script uses different types of quotes (`â€™` instead of `'`) which can cause syntax errors in Python.

4. **IndexError**: The `summarize_column` function assumes that the provided index is valid and that there are enough rows to compute the average, which can raise an `IndexError`.

5. **Division by Zero**: If there are no valid numeric entries in the column, the average calculation will attempt to divide by zero.

6. **Lack of Type Checking**: The script does not check if the values in the column can be converted to `float`, which can raise a `ValueError`.

7. **Global Variables and Hardcoding**: The `filepath` is hardcoded and not flexible. Ideally, it should be passed as an argument.

8. **No Documentation or Comments**: The functions lack docstrings, making it hard to understand their purpose.

### Refactored Code

```python
import csv
import os

def read_csv(filepath):
    """Read a CSV file and return its content as a list of rows."""
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file '{filepath}' does not exist.")
    
    with open(filepath, 'r', newline='') as f:
        return list(csv.reader(f))

def summarize_column(data, index):
    """Summarize the numeric values in a specified column."""
    try:
        values = [float(row[index]) for row in data[1:] if row[index]]  # Skip header and ensure non-empty
    except IndexError:
        raise ValueError(f"Index {index} is out of bounds for the data provided.")
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("All values in the specified column must be numeric.")

    if not values:
        return 0, 0  # Return zero if no valid values are found

    total = sum(values)
    avg = total / len(values)
    return total, avg

def main(filepath='data.csv'):
    """Main function to read a CSV file and print the total and average of a specified column."""
    data = read_csv(filepath)
    try:
        total, avg = summarize_column(data, 1)  # Change index as necessary
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error summarizing column: {e}")
        return

    print("Total:", total)
    print("Average:", avg)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Improvements Made

1. **Corrected Indentation**: Fixed the indentation in the `read_csv` function.
2. **Error Handling**: Added checks for file existence and improved exception handling for `IndexError` and `ValueError`.
3. **Consistent Quoting**: Changed all quotes to single quotes for consistency.
4. **Safe Conversion**: The `summarize_column` function now checks for empty strings and handles conversion errors.
5. **Flexibility**: Made the `filepath` in the `main` function a parameter with a default value.
6. **Documentation**: Added docstrings to functions for better understanding.
7. **Return Zero Values**: The function now returns `(0, 0)` if no valid numeric values are found, preventing division by zero.

This refactored code should work more reliably and be easier to maintain and understand.
