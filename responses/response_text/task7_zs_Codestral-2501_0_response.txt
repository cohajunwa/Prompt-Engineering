The code snippet you provided has a risk of a null dereference. Specifically, the `s.length()` method call will throw a `NullPointerException` if the input string `s` is `null`. To mitigate this risk, you should add a null check before calling the `length()` method. Here is an improved version of the method:

```java
public int getLength(String s) {
    if (s == null) {
        return 0; // or throw an exception, depending on the desired behavior
    }
    return s.length();
}
```

In this revised version, the method checks if `s` is `null` and returns `0` if it is. Alternatively, you could choose to throw an appropriate exception to signal that the input was invalid:

```java
public int getLength(String s) {
    if (s == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input string cannot be null");
    }
    return s.length();
}
```

Using either of these approaches ensures that the method behaves gracefully or explicitly communicates that the input was invalid.
