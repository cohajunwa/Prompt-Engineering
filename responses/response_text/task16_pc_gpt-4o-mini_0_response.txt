The provided binary search implementation is incomplete. Here are the missing parts and required corrections to make the function work properly:

1. **Comparison Logic**: Inside the while loop, you need to compare the middle element (`arr[mid]`) with the target value. Depending on the comparison, you should adjust the `left` or `right` pointers.

2. **Return Statement**: If the target is found, you should return the index `mid`. The current implementation only has a return statement at the end, which returns `-1` (indicating that the target was not found) without checking if the target was actually found.

Hereâ€™s the corrected implementation:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) { 
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1; 
    while (left <= right) { 
        int mid = (left + right) / 2; 
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Target found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Search in the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Search in the left half
        }
    } 
    return -1; // Target not found
}
```

### Summary of Changes Made:
- Added a check for equality `arr[mid] == target` to return the index if the target is found.
- Added the condition `arr[mid] < target` to adjust the `left` pointer when the target is greater than the middle value.
- Added the condition `arr[mid] > target` to adjust the `right` pointer when the target is less than the middle value.

With these changes, the binary search function should now work correctly.
