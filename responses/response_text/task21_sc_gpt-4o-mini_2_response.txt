Let's analyze the provided utility script for any potential logic issues or design flaws and then refactor it for better readability, correctness, and safety.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Indentation Error:** The `return` statement in the `read_csv` function is not properly indented.
2. **File Handling:** The script does not handle potential exceptions that may arise from file operations (e.g., file not found, permission denied, etc.).
3. **Data Conversion:** The script assumes that all values in the specified column can be converted to `float`, which may not be the case if there are non-numeric values.
4. **Hardcoded File Path:** The file path is hardcoded, making it less flexible. It should ideally be passed as an argument.
5. **Indexing:** The script assumes the second column (index 1) always contains numeric data. It would be better to make this configurable.
6. **Magic Strings:** The script uses hardcoded strings for the file name. Using constants or parameters would improve clarity.
7. **Style Issues:** The script contains inconsistent spacing and quote styles (e.g., `’data .csv ’` has spaces and uses smart quotes).
8. **Main Block Check:** There is a space in the main block check that would prevent it from executing (`'__main__ '`).

### Refactored Code:

Here’s a refactored version of the script addressing the above issues:

```python
import csv
import os

def read_csv(filepath):
    """Reads a CSV file and returns its content as a list of rows."""
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file '{filepath}' does not exist.")
    
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return [row for row in csv.reader(f)]

def summarize_column(data, index):
    """Summarizes a specific column in the data,
       returning the total and average of its numeric values."""
    try:
        values = [float(row[index]) for row in data[1:] if row[index]]  # Skip header and check for empty cells
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Non-numeric data found in column {index + 1}: {e}")
    
    if not values:
        raise ValueError("No valid numeric values found in the specified column.")
    
    total = sum(values)
    avg = total / len(values)
    return total, avg

def main(filepath='data.csv', column_index=1):
    """Main function to read a CSV file and summarize a specified column."""
    try:
        data = read_csv(filepath)
        total, avg = summarize_column(data, column_index)
        print(f"Total: {total}")
        print(f"Average: {avg}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Improvements Made:

1. **Corrected Indentation:** The `return` statement in `read_csv` is now correctly indented.
2. **Exception Handling:** The script now raises exceptions for file errors and data conversion issues, providing clear feedback.
3. **Flexible File Path and Column Index:** The file path and column index can now be easily adjusted through function parameters.
4. **Empty Value Handling:** The `summarize_column` function handles rows where the specified column might be empty.
5. **Error Messages:** Helpful error messages are included to guide the user in case of issues.
6. **Improved Style and Consistency:** Code style issues such as spacing and quote consistency were corrected for better readability. 

This refactored code is more robust, readable, and user-friendly.
