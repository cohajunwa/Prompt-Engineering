The bug in the `factorial` function lies in the range used in the for loop. The `range(1, n)` will iterate from 1 to `n-1`, which means it does not include `n` itself. Therefore, the function will compute the factorial of `n-1` instead of `n`.

To fix this, you should change the range to include `n`. You can do this by using `range(1, n + 1)`:

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1 
    for i in range(1, n + 1): 
        result *= i 
    return result
```

Now, the function will correctly compute the factorial of `n`. 

Additionally, you may want to handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of 0 is 1 by definition. Hereâ€™s an improved version of the function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    result = 1 
    for i in range(1, n + 1): 
        result *= i 
    return result
``` 

This implementation ensures that the function behaves correctly for all valid inputs.
