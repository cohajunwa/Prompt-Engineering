The issue with the given `factorial` function is that the loop starts from 1 and ranges up to `n-1`, which means it does not include `n` in the multiplication. To fix this, you should change the loop to range from 1 to `n` inclusive. Additionally, you need to handle the input `0` correctly since the factorial of `0` is `1` by definition.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

This function now correctly computes the factorial of `n` for any non-negative integer `n`, including `0`. The loop now includes `n` in the multiplication, and a check is added to raise an error for negative inputs.
