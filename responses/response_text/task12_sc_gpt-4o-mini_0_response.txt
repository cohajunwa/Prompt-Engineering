The issue with the provided `factorial` function is that it does not handle the case when the input is `0`. The factorial of `0` is defined to be `1`. Additionally, the loop in your code does not include `n` itself, which is not a problem for positive integers, but it leads to incorrect results.

Here's how you can fix it:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
    result = 1 
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Change range to include n
        result *= i 
    return result
```

With this modification:
- If `n` is `0`, the result will correctly be `1`.
- The loop now runs from `1` to `n` inclusive, ensuring that `n` itself is included in the multiplication.
- An error is raised for negative inputs, as factorials for negative numbers are not defined. 

You can test the function as follows:

```python
print(factorial(0))  # Output: 1
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```
