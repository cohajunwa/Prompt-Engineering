Sure! Here is the function that checks if a number is prime based on the given comment:

```python
# This function checks if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

This function follows the steps to determine if a number `n` is prime:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it is prime.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime.
4. For other numbers, it checks divisibility by numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`.
