Let's analyze the script step by step to identify potential logic issues or design flaws, and then we'll refactor it for better readability, correctness, and safety.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Syntax Errors**:
   - The `read_csv` function has incorrect indentation for the return statement.
   - There are syntax errors with the string literals (e.g., `’data .csv ’` should be `'data.csv'`).

2. **Incorrect File Path**:
   - The file path `'data .csv '` contains an extra space, which will cause a `FileNotFoundError` if the file is actually named `data.csv`.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The script does not handle cases where the file does not exist or where the CSV contents are not as expected (e.g., non-numeric values in the column to be summarized).

4. **Column Index**:
   - The script assumes that the column to be summarized is always the second column (index 1). This might not be a safe assumption.

5. **Code Readability**:
   - The script lacks proper docstrings and comments to explain the purpose of functions and key steps.

### Refactored Code:

```python
# utils.py - Script to parse and summarize numeric CSV files

import csv
from typing import List, Tuple

def read_csv(filepath: str) -> List[List[str]]:
    """
    Reads a CSV file and returns its contents as a list of rows.

    Args:
        filepath (str): The path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
        List[List[str]]: The contents of the CSV file as a list of rows.
    """
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            return [row for row in csv.reader(f)]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found.")
        return []

def summarize_column(data: List[List[str]], index: int) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Summarizes a numeric column in the CSV data.

    Args:
        data (List[List[str]]): The CSV data as a list of rows.
        index (int): The index of the column to summarize.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: The total and average of the column.
    """
    try:
        values = [float(row[index]) for row in data[1:]]  # Skip header
        total = sum(values)
        avg = total / len(values)
        return total, avg
    except (IndexError, ValueError) as e:
        print("Error processing column. Ensure the column index exists and contains numeric values.")
        print(e)
        return 0.0, 0.0

def main():
    """
    Main function to read the CSV file and summarize a column.
    """
    filepath = 'data.csv'
    data = read_csv(filepath)
    if not data:
        return

    try:
        total, avg = summarize_column(data, 1)  # Assuming the second column
        print("Total:", total)
        print("Average:", avg)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred while summarizing the column.")
        print(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Changes Made:

1. **Syntax Correction**: Fixed indentation and string literals.
2. **Error Handling**: Added error handling for file reading and column summarization.
3. **Type Hints and Docstrings**: Added type hints and docstrings for better readability and maintainability.
4. **Check for Empty Data**: Added a check to return early if the data is empty after reading the CSV file.
5. **Column Index**: Retained the assumption that the column to summarize is the second column, but added error handling to manage cases where this might not be true.

This refactored version should be more robust and easier to understand, while maintaining the original functionality.
