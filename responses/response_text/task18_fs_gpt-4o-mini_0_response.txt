The function `isEven(n)` is intended to check if a number is even, but it currently returns `1` for odd numbers and `0` for even numbers, which is not equivalent to `true` or `false`. 

Here's the fixed code:

```javascript
function isEven(n) { 
    return n % 2 === 0; // Returns true for even numbers, false for odd numbers
}
```

In this fixed version, the expression `n % 2 === 0` evaluates to `true` if `n` is even (i.e., the remainder when `n` is divided by `2` is `0`) and `false` if `n` is odd.
