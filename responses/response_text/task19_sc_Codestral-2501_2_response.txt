To decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps for the function `process`, we can break down the process into the following steps:

1. **Input Validation**: Check if the input `x` is negative.
   - If `x` is negative, return `-1` to indicate an invalid input.

2. **Calculation**: If the input `x` is non-negative, calculate the square of `x`.
   - The square of `x` is obtained by multiplying `x` by itself, i.e., `x * x`.

3. **Return Result**: Return the calculated square value.

Here is the decomposed function with these steps explicitly stated:

```c
int process(int x) {
    // Step 1: Input Validation
    if (x < 0) {
        return -1; // Invalid input, return -1
    }

    // Step 2: Calculation
    int result = x * x; // Calculate the square of x

    // Step 3: Return Result
    return result; // Return the calculated square value
}
```

This breakdown makes the function clearer and easier to understand. Each logical step is performed sequentially, and the function returns the appropriate result based on the input.
