The `countWordFrequency` method takes a list of strings, `words`, as input and returns a map that represents the frequency of each word in the list. It initializes an empty `HashMap` called `freqMap`. The method iterates over each word in the `words` list and updates the frequency count for each word in the map. If a word is already present in the map, its count is incremented; if it is not present, it is added with an initial count of 1. Finally, the method returns the `freqMap`, which contains each unique word from the list as a key and its corresponding frequency as the value.
