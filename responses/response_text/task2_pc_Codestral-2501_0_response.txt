The off-by-one error in the function `sum_range` is in the range of the `for` loop. The `range(start, end)` function generates numbers from `start` up to, but not including, `end`. This means that the last number in the range is `end - 1`, not `end`.

Here is the relevant part of the code with the issue highlighted:
```python
for i in range(start, end):
```
This loop will include `start` but will not include `end` itself. If you want to include `end` in the summation, the range needs to be adjusted.
