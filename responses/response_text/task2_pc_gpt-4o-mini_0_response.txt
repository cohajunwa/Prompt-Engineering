The off-by-one error in the `sum_range` function occurs in the `for` loop where the `range(start, end)` is used. The `range` function generates numbers starting from `start` up to, but not including, `end`. Therefore, if the intention is to include the `end` value in the sum, the loop should iterate up to and including `end`. As it currently stands, the function will exclude `end` from the total sum.
