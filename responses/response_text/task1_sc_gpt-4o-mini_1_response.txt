The `countWordFrequency` method takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a map (`freqMap`) that represents the frequency of each unique word in the list. It uses a `HashMap` to store the word as the key and its corresponding count as the value. The method iterates through each word in the input list, updating the count for each word by using the `getOrDefault` method to retrieve the current count (or 0 if the word is not yet in the map) and incrementing it by 1. Finally, it returns the frequency map containing each word and its frequency count.
