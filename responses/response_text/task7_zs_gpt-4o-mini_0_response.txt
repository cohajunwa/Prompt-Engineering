The code you provided does indeed have a null dereference risk. Specifically, if the input string `s` is `null`, calling `s.length()` will throw a `NullPointerException`. 

To mitigate this risk, you should check if `s` is `null` before attempting to access its length. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the method that handles the null case gracefully:

```java
public int getLength(String s) {
    if (s == null) {
        return 0; // or handle it as needed, e.g., throw an exception
    }
    return s.length();
}
```

In this revised version, if `s` is `null`, the method returns `0` (or you could choose to handle it in another way, such as throwing an exception, depending on your requirements). This way, you avoid the risk of a null dereference.
