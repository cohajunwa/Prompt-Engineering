The bug in the given `factorial` function is in the range of the `for` loop. The loop should iterate from `1` to `n` inclusive, but the current implementation iterates from `1` to `n-1`. This means that the loop does not multiply the result by `n`, which is necessary to compute the factorial correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Change n to n + 1 to include n in the range
        result *= i
    return result
```

With this correction, the loop will iterate from `1` to `n`, inclusive, ensuring that all numbers from `1` to `n` are multiplied together to compute the factorial.
